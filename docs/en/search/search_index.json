The knowledge worker is characterized by the fact that he knows better about the work task and the necessary knowledge than the managers of the organization, and therefore - in contrast to Taylorism or Scientific Management, in which there is a separation between head work and manual work - organizes himself to the greatest possible extent.</p> <p>The organizational sociologist Hellmut Willke defines knowledge work as activities such as communication, transaction and interaction, which are characterized by the fact that they require knowledge that has not been acquired once in life, for example through experience, initiation, teaching, specialized training or professionalization, and can then be continuously applied. Instead, it is precisely the knowledge that emerges in the lifelong learning process that is charaketistic and action-guiding for knowledge work.

To do this, there must be autonomous room for maneuver.</li> <li>Continuous innovation is a part of the work that is the task and responsibility of knowledge workers.</li> <li>knowledge work goes hand in hand with continuous learning on the one hand and continuous teaching by knowledge workers on the other hand.</li> <li>the productivity of the knowledge worker is primarily not a question of the quantity of the results. The devil is often in the details, so quality is at least as important.</li> <li>in conclusion, the productivity of knowledge workers requires that knowledge workers are an \"asset \" and not a \"cost factor\" and are treated accordingly.

However, knowledge alone is not enough to be successful. It is just as important, if not more important, to think knowledge further in order to combine it into something new. For example, to accomplish tasks and projects more efficiently, to adapt quickly to new demands and challenges, to better understand and pursue goals and plans, or to use study time more efficiently. However, this is easier said than done. Fortunately, there are personal knowledge management methods that can help. One of these methods is the note box method.</p> <p>The notebox method is based on a bottom-up topic structure and aims to put thoughts and ideas in one central place and connect them to each other in order to gain new insights, internalize knowledge and create sound texts. It may take a while to see the first results, but if you use the slip box method continuously, you will benefit from the rich harvest.</p> <p>In order to use the note box method successfully, it is important to use it on a daily basis. Read and jot down your thoughts on what you read. Precisely formulate your notes and link your knowledge together. Connect your ideas and create overlapping connections. Ask yourself questions and try to answer them. Through this continuous thinking in the notebook, you will deepen your knowledge and generate new ideas.</p> <p>In practice, the slip box method can be used in everyday work, study, and personal life. It can help to write well-founded articles, to make extensive thoughts tangible and to deepen your own knowledge. It is also helpful when writing articles, forum posts, social media posts, because you collect thoughts, prepare them and can insert them directly in an outline and have your contributions with depth already 90% ready.</p> <p>Where the method can support you - Professionally     - It facilitates efficient and successful completion of tasks and projects.     - It supports career development by helping to build and demonstrate relevant knowledge and skills.     - It enables faster adaptation to new job demands and challenges.     - It increases productivity and the ability to make decisions quickly.     - It improves communication and collaboration within the organization. - Private     - It helps to better understand and follow one's goals and plans.     - It supports self-organization and enables better management of time and tasks.     - It promotes personal and intellectual development by helping to build new knowledge and skills.     - It enables better management of finances and resources.     - It increases the ability to solve problems and make decisions more quickly and effectively. - In studies     - It supports the understanding and retention of learning content and facilitates preparation for exams.     - It promotes the development of self-learning strategies and the ability to acquire knowledge independently.     - It enables more efficient use of study time and resources.     - It promotes the ability to make connections between different subjects and disciplines.     - It increases opportunities for successful career and professional development.</p> <p>The slip box method was developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann (*8.12.1927), who was able to publish about 70 books and 400 articles with its help.

It applies various criteria against which the goal definition is measured. This way you have the guarantee to reach a smart goal.</p> <p>Specific: Is it really clear what you want to do, or are you perhaps too vague in your wording? What is included, and especially what is not? Only if you really know exactly what you want to do and at the same time know the limits of your intention, you can set out and be sure that you will arrive on the way in any case without getting bogged down or even losing your orientation.</p> <p>Messbar: What must have happened so that you can say that your goal has been achieved. What work result is there then? For example, if you want to get \"better\" at something, what do you need to do and how often to get enough practice? Formulate in such a conclusive and measurable way that you can achieve just that. Essentially, ask yourself what you want to get better at or what exactly this \"better\" can be tied to. Characterize the first point, because the more specific you are in defining your goal, the more likely you are to get a result that meets your expectations, that can be further improved, and that can be markedly evaluated.</p> <p>Attractive: Your goal must motivate you. You must want to achieve it if you want to spend 12 weeks to make it come true. Therefore, this point is especially important. It should be a goal that you have personally chosen for yourself and with which you can identify 100%. A goal that others set for me will rarely trigger the same desire in me to achieve it as one that springs from my own heart. In some explanations of the SMART formula, the A also stands for Anchallenging. Will mean that your goal should not be too easy. You should make a little effort and challenge yourself, because if you stay too far away from your personal limits and actually still chill in your comfort zone, you can rarely really improve. Ultimately, you need to go a little beyond your comfort zone without completely overtaxing yourself, because that's where growth begins. Caution. Overextending yourself won't yield sustainable results, and by and large, this learning path is meant to bring one thing above all else: a lot of fun! And that can quickly fall by the wayside if your goals are too ambitious.</p> <p></p> <p>Realistic: The learning path goes 12 weeks and therefore you should also choose a goal that is really achievable in this time. Stay down to earth when defining your goals. You can achieve anything at a snail's pace and with perseverance. It is also key to question yourself in advance: Are you one of those people who like to choose their goals a little more challenging? How much time do you really have available each week? Does the whole thing really fit into the framework of the 12 weeks of the Learning Sprint? If it has to be, then say goodbye to one or the other idea for the time being. Ultimately, the first sprint is good training that will eventually become second nature. The current learning sprint may only have been a prelude. :-)</p> <p>Terminated: Another important requirement of your goal that you should pay attention to is the date of completion. In the context of the learning sprint, this date can actually be determined very precisely. And that's important, too, because it gives you the opportunity to check whether you're still on track in terms of deliverables, open items, and any problems or obstacles, or whether you might need to put more energy into your work on the project or conclusively scale down your goal in order to achieve it at all. In week 7 we will look at the first interim results. A good moment to look at your own goal again from the SMART perspective and if necessary to readjust it a bit.</p> <p>Example of goal setting with OKRs.</p> <p>As easy as the card box is to explain, as challenging it can be to work with it at the beginning. For this reason, we recommend setting a concrete goal and possibly starting with a small project. To make this a little more concrete, here is an example.</p> <p>Nima has started to study wants to work in science in the future, so clean scientific work and the corresponding writing organization should be practiced from the beginning.</p> <p>Nima's goal for week 12 in the notebox learning path is to develop a routine in using the notebox. Therefore, Nima is considering working on this very routine with an upcoming term paper. For starters, it is very challenging to write 15 pages from the note box, so it makes sense to define even more key outcomes.</p> <p>The question that can help you to define the Key Results is: How do I know that I am getting closer to my Objective?</p> <p>1st Key Result: The key result that is obvious is the 15 pages written. 2nd Key Result: Nima has developed a complete workflow.

But your notes are still easy to keep track of. However, if your note box continues to grow, it may start to become confusing. Therefore, it is now a question of how you can find your knowledge in your note box again, if it becomes more and more extensive. An important requirement of your system is the retrievability of information.</p> <p>Retrievability means being able to find information you once stored later when you need it. This contrasts with information retrieval, where you know the information you are looking for is in a specific document and you have to search that document specifically. An important aspect of linking knowledge is the ability to link to notes that fit the topic. Of course, this is most easily done if you remember that you have that information in your Zettelkasten. Otherwise, we are already in the topic, how do you find information back in your note box?</p> <p>Successful knowledge management should therefore originate bottom-up topic oriented and have indexes, or Map Of Content (MOC) notes, as entry points. This way, you can avoid getting lost in the flood of notes and instead search specifically for information that you had in your head but can no longer name precisely. Or even \"stumbles\" across information that you had \"forgotten\" was in the system.</p> <p>Factors that influence the retrievability of information include the structure and organization of the notes, the use of keywords and tags, the possibility of full-text search, and the use of metadata.</p> <p>One way to improve retrievability is to create indexes or a Map of Content (MOC). This defines major points of contact from which more detailed information can be accessed. Another option is the use of tags to quickly browse topic affiliations. However, the TAGs should be used rather sparingly, too many TAGs can lead to not seeing the forest for the trees. TAGs should also be maintained regularly to remain useful. A full-text search within the notes makes it possible to search specifically for certain terms. By using metadata, such as aliases, authors or book titles, notes can be filtered and sorted specifically. Another way to make notes retrievable is to link them to each other. This makes it easy to move from one topic to the next and keep the information thematically coherent. What emerges in the previous exercise when you get bogged down.

MOCs are entry points to larger subject areas. They are a map to your knowledge with which you can safely orient yourself within a topic area. They allow you to get a quick overview without having to read all the details again. If necessary, you can of course read deeper into the details. As I said, you can get an overview of a topic with a lot of notes by using a MOC and you can also elaborate it more. Think of a MOC as a room where all the notes on a topic can exist without you having to combine them directly in a meaningful way, but you could. You can just create a room in your Zettelkasten that contains all the notes on a topic and you don't have a compulsion to link them directly now in a logical and sequential way. They may all be in there.</p> <p>Now you may ask yourself, when should you create a MOC? Nick Milo has some helpful advice here and also immediately suggested a method we use here. You should create a MOC when you have the feeling to lose the overview of a topic. Then it is really high time. An indication could also be if you keep looking for information, but can't find it directly. In the following you can see the regular procedure to create a MOC. You probably don't have that many notes in your system yet since you just started, so don't be irritated if the exercise seems a bit generic. It's all about methodology, and MOCs are really important as your notebox grows. That's why we are already dealing with the general creation, try it out for yourself. </p> <ol> <li>get all notes about the topic into a new note</li> <li>weigh the notes against each other, work out thoughts, divide, structure. This is where new insights emerge because you are intensely engaged with your thoughts. This process can take several days. You create an overview of the topic based on your notes.</li> <li>Link the MOC in the system and ensure findability</li> </ol> <p>Keep in mind that MOCs will continue to evolve, they are not static. As your knowledge grows the time will come to update a MOC. The notes will be weighed against each other again. A MOC can in turn contain several MOCs and thus a whole hierarchy of MOCs on a topic can emerge.</p> <p>Here again the most important points to MOCs - offers entry points to larger topics and helps to get an overview and to work out topics with many notes. - Should be created when there is a feeling of losing track of a topic. - MOCs can evolve - a MOC can contain several MOCs.</p>"},{"location":"2-1-Kata-13/#exercises","title":"Exercises","text":"<ul> <li>Choose a topic for which you want to create a MOC.<ul> <li>It makes sense to choose a topic for which you have several notes in your Zettelkasten.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Gather all your notes on that topic into a new note.</li> <li>Go through all the notes and weigh them against each other.

New connections, insights and new questions arise from this. It is thought in the note box, or with the note box. The interesting aspect becomes that thinking becomes more objective, since all previous thoughts can lie on the table, can lie next to each other. It becomes possible to objectively draw comparisons between parallel and even contradictory thoughts. When a question arises, it is a good approach to search in the first instance in one's own note box, because there is already a high quality of thoughts and selections. When thinking in the note box, I try to answer my own questions that I have about a thought, further questions. One thing leads to another and a train of thought unfolds.

On the one hand you have to grasp it quickly and on the other hand this only happens if you follow the always same structure of the note. This way your brain has accordingly the capacities it needs free to actually grasp the information dynamically. The recognition effect that is in the DNA of your note can actually serve you well....</p> <p>You can use your own structure. Maybe you already have one you feel comfortable with and want to keep using it. That's perfectly fine. You can also create one according to your own ideas.

This is predetermined by the brain's system. You use this when you create your note. Therefore, linking relevant information increases the findability and memorability of the information.

This means that control characters are used in the text to indicate how the text should be displayed. So the control characters really go directly into the text.

But don't worry, you don't have to program here, very few characters are enough and the programs then display the text without the control characters. To give you an idea of what this is all about, here is a practical example.</p> <p>On the left is the text with the formatting characters. On the right is what you then see in the display. </p> <p>The big advantage is that they are all text files (like the .txt extension you sometimes see on your computer).

There are many programs that use proprietary formats. Proprietary formats are formats created by a particular company or developer that can only be used with their products. An example of this would be the format of a note in the Evernote app that cannot be opened in other note apps.</p> <p>Unfortunately, however, there are difficulties and risks associated with using proprietary formats. One of them is that you are trapped in a dependency on a particular company or developer, since you cannot change or export the format without using the corresponding product. Another risk is that the format may eventually be discontinued by the company or developer, which may mean that you can no longer open your notes. The accumulated knowledge is then lost.</p> <p>One solution to this could be to implement a switching strategy. One possibility would be to create all new notes from now on in an open format like Markdown, in a suitable program. If one then later searches for old notes, one can search for them in the old program and then transfer them to the new program. The advantage here would be that the transfer only happens when it is really necessary and the energy is distributed for it.</p> <p>Another suggestion for a switch strategy could be to look for tools that can convert the proprietary format to an open format like Markdown. This way, you could export your old notes to a format that is supported by many different applications and you no longer have to feel dependent on a particular company or developer.</p>"},{"location":"3-0-3-Guide-PKM-mit-OneNote/","title":"Guide um PKM mit OneNote umzusetzen","text":""},{"location":"3-0-3-Guide-PKM-mit-OneNote/#guide-to-implement-pkm-with-onenote","title":"Guide to implement PKM with OneNote","text":"<p>Guide to implement PKM with OneNote, if more suitable tools (e.g. those from week 2) are not available, e.g. due to restrictions from IT policies in a company.</p> <ul> <li>use [[PAGE NAME]] to directly create links</li> <li>enable the wiki link function in OneNote </li> <li>OneNote wiki link application </li> <li>all notes into one notebook</li> <li>tab \"MOC\" could be used to collect all MOCs</li> <li>create a separate page for each idea to be able to link specifically</li> <li>Use speaking titles for page titles</li> </ul>"},{"location":"3-0-99-Aenderungshistorie/","title":"Change history","text":""},{"location":"3-0-99-Aenderungshistorie/#change-history","title":"Change history","text":"<p>All changes to the guide can be found in the Release Notes on Github.
