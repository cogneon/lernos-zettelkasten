Peter Drucker fasst im Buch \"Management Challenges for the 21st Century\" die Produktivit\u00e4t von Wissensarbeitern in sechs Faktoren zusammen: Die Produktivit\u00e4t der Wissensarbeiter erfordert, dass wir uns als erstes fragen Was ist die Aufgabe? Wissensarbeit verlangt von uns, dass wir die Verantwortung f\u00fcr die Produktivit\u00e4t auf einzelne Wissensarbeitende \u00fcbertragen, dazu m\u00fcssen wir ihnen einen Vertrauensvorschuss geben, denn Wissensarbeitende m\u00fcssen sich selbst managen. Daf\u00fcr muss ein autonomer Handlungsspielraum vorhanden sein. Kontinuierliche Innovation ist ein Teil der Arbeit, die in der Aufgabe und Verantwortung von Wissensarbeitenden steht. Wissensarbeit geht einerseits mit einem kontinuierlichen Lernprozess und andererseits mit einem kontinuierlichen Lehren durch die Wissensarbeitenden einher. Die Produktivit\u00e4t der Wissensarbeitenden Fachkraft ist prim\u00e4r keine Frage der Quantit\u00e4t der Ergebnisse.

Growth Mindset von Carol Dweck, Open Mindset von Gary Hamel)? Skillset - wie gut sind meine Kompetenzen und F\u00e4higkeiten in Bezug auf das Lernen (s.a.

Web 2.0 , Agile Methoden )? Dein lernOS Workplace ist eine sehr individuelle Angelegenheit, deswegen solltest du dir diesen jeweils m\u00f6glichst gut nach deinen Bed\u00fcrfnissen gestalten. In der Regel ist dieser Platz auch nicht nur an einem Ort, sondern an mehreren. Bei Sch\u00fcler_innen kann das z.B. die Schule und das eigene Zimmer sein.

Your goal definition and making an appointment with yourself. Goal definition Theory/questions What do you want to achieve in the next twelve weeks? You can choose a goal that is really, really important to you and with which you will make very concrete progress during the sprint. However, especially for PKM beginners, achieving the goal is not the top priority. In addition to learning the basic knowledge, the environment, the findability and permanence of notes, the focus is still very much on regularly applying the newly gained skills. In particular and last but not least, one main thing is our focus: having a lot of fun! :D To ensure optimal learning success, it is important to set goals that motivate you and make your progress tangible and visible. You'll want to set your goals using the SMART formula or use Google's OKR method^[links in the \"More Information\" section] to define your goal. Consider whether you might want to work toward a specific product. This could be, for example, a blog article for your co-workers, or a first publication, or, or, or.... Visualize your goal. For this purpose, you can use different technical tools on the Internet. Think about how you will share your progress in the Circle. In other words, if your first priority is to check-in, that's a bit low. Consider what documentation tools are out there that are good for logging your progress. Define goals using the SMART formula. Autor: Dmitry Using the SMART method is a good way to define a goal. It applies various criteria against which the goal definition is measured. This way you have the guarantee to reach a smart goal. S pecific: Is it really clear what you want to do, or are you perhaps too vague in your wording? What is included, and especially what is not? Only if you really know exactly what you want to do and at the same time know the limits of your intention, you can set out and be sure that you will arrive on the way in any case without getting bogged down or even losing your orientation. M essbar: What must have happened so that you can say that your goal has been achieved. What work result is there then? For example, if you want to get \"better\" at something, what do you need to do and how often to get enough practice? Formulate in such a conclusive and measurable way that you can achieve just that. Essentially, ask yourself what you want to get better at or what exactly this \"better\" can be tied to. Characterize the first point, because the more specific you are in defining your goal, the more likely you are to get a result that meets your expectations, that can be further improved, and that can be markedly evaluated. A ttractive: Your goal must motivate you. You must want to achieve it if you want to spend 12 weeks to make it come true. Therefore, this point is especially important. It should be a goal that you have personally chosen for yourself and with which you can identify 100%. A goal that others set for me will rarely trigger the same desire in me to achieve it as one that springs from my own heart. In some explanations of the SMART formula, the A also stands for A nchallenging. Will mean that your goal should not be too easy. You should make a little effort and challenge yourself, because if you stay too far away from your personal limits and actually still chill in your comfort zone, you can rarely really improve. Ultimately, you need to go a little beyond your comfort zone without completely overtaxing yourself, because that's where growth begins. Caution. Overextending yourself won't yield sustainable results, and by and large, this learning path is meant to bring one thing above all else: a lot of fun! And that can quickly fall by the wayside if your goals are too ambitious. R ealistic: The learning path goes 12 weeks and therefore you should also choose a goal that is really achievable in this time. Stay down to earth when defining your goals. You can achieve anything at a snail's pace and with perseverance. It is also key to question yourself in advance: Are you one of those people who like to choose their goals a little more challenging? How much time do you really have available each week? Does the whole thing really fit into the framework of the 12 weeks of the Learning Sprint? If it has to be, then say goodbye to one or the other idea for the time being. Ultimately, the first sprint is good training that will eventually become second nature. The current learning sprint may only have been a prelude. :-) T erminated: Another important requirement of your goal that you should pay attention to is the date of completion. In the context of the learning sprint, this date can actually be determined very precisely. And that's important, too, because it gives you the opportunity to check whether you're still on track in terms of deliverables, open items, and any problems or obstacles, or whether you might need to put more energy into your work on the project or conclusively scale down your goal in order to achieve it at all. In week 7 we will look at the first interim results. A good moment to look at your own goal again from the SMART perspective and if necessary to readjust it a bit. Example of goal setting with OKRs . As easy as the card box is to explain, as challenging it can be to work with it at the beginning. For this reason, we recommend setting a concrete goal and possibly starting with a small project. To make this a little more concrete, here is an example. Nima has started to study wants to work in science in the future, so clean scientific work and the corresponding writing organization should be practiced from the beginning. Nima's goal for week 12 in the notebox learning path is to develop a routine in using the notebox. Therefore, Nima is considering working on this very routine with an upcoming term paper. For starters, it is very challenging to write 15 pages from the note box, so it makes sense to define even more key outcomes. The question that can help you to define the Key Results is: How do I know that I am getting closer to my Objective? 1st Key Result: The key result that is obvious is the 15 pages written. 2nd Key Result: Nima has developed a complete workflow. This includes a reading routine, transferring notes to permanent notes, linking thoughts,.... **Additional Information. Wikipedia article SMART Criteria (English).

A good approach is to make an appointment with yourself and reserve this time in your calendar. More information: Video: 7 Big Rocks Podcast: Never enough time? Schedule your priorities by colorcoding your calendars tasks/exercises Check your calendar and look for possible dates with yourself. An hour or even 30 minutes a week is a good starting point. Put an appointment with yourself on the calendar. If possible, make it a recurring appointment so that this time becomes a habit for you. Find at least five appointments: ... ... ... ... ...

You can choose a goal that is really, really important to you and with which you will make very concrete progress during the sprint. However, especially for PKM beginners, achieving the goal is not the top priority. In addition to learning the basic knowledge, the environment, the findability and permanence of notes, the focus is still very much on regularly applying the newly gained skills. In particular and last but not least, one main thing is our focus: having a lot of fun! :D To ensure optimal learning success, it is important to set goals that motivate you and make your progress tangible and visible. You'll want to set your goals using the SMART formula or use Google's OKR method^[links in the \"More Information\" section] to define your goal. Consider whether you might want to work toward a specific product. This could be, for example, a blog article for your co-workers, or a first publication, or, or, or.... Visualize your goal. For this purpose, you can use different technical tools on the Internet. Think about how you will share your progress in the Circle. In other words, if your first priority is to check-in, that's a bit low. Consider what documentation tools are out there that are good for logging your progress.","title":"Theory/questions"},{"location":"2-1-Kata-1/#define-goals-using-the-smart-formula","text":"Autor: Dmitry Using the SMART method is a good way to define a goal. It applies various criteria against which the goal definition is measured. This way you have the guarantee to reach a smart goal. S pecific: Is it really clear what you want to do, or are you perhaps too vague in your wording? What is included, and especially what is not? Only if you really know exactly what you want to do and at the same time know the limits of your intention, you can set out and be sure that you will arrive on the way in any case without getting bogged down or even losing your orientation. M essbar: What must have happened so that you can say that your goal has been achieved. What work result is there then? For example, if you want to get \"better\" at something, what do you need to do and how often to get enough practice? Formulate in such a conclusive and measurable way that you can achieve just that. Essentially, ask yourself what you want to get better at or what exactly this \"better\" can be tied to. Characterize the first point, because the more specific you are in defining your goal, the more likely you are to get a result that meets your expectations, that can be further improved, and that can be markedly evaluated. A ttractive: Your goal must motivate you. You must want to achieve it if you want to spend 12 weeks to make it come true. Therefore, this point is especially important. It should be a goal that you have personally chosen for yourself and with which you can identify 100%. A goal that others set for me will rarely trigger the same desire in me to achieve it as one that springs from my own heart. In some explanations of the SMART formula, the A also stands for A nchallenging. Will mean that your goal should not be too easy. You should make a little effort and challenge yourself, because if you stay too far away from your personal limits and actually still chill in your comfort zone, you can rarely really improve. Ultimately, you need to go a little beyond your comfort zone without completely overtaxing yourself, because that's where growth begins. Caution. Overextending yourself won't yield sustainable results, and by and large, this learning path is meant to bring one thing above all else: a lot of fun! And that can quickly fall by the wayside if your goals are too ambitious. R ealistic: The learning path goes 12 weeks and therefore you should also choose a goal that is really achievable in this time. Stay down to earth when defining your goals. You can achieve anything at a snail's pace and with perseverance. It is also key to question yourself in advance: Are you one of those people who like to choose their goals a little more challenging? How much time do you really have available each week? Does the whole thing really fit into the framework of the 12 weeks of the Learning Sprint? If it has to be, then say goodbye to one or the other idea for the time being. Ultimately, the first sprint is good training that will eventually become second nature. The current learning sprint may only have been a prelude. :-) T erminated: Another important requirement of your goal that you should pay attention to is the date of completion. In the context of the learning sprint, this date can actually be determined very precisely. And that's important, too, because it gives you the opportunity to check whether you're still on track in terms of deliverables, open items, and any problems or obstacles, or whether you might need to put more energy into your work on the project or conclusively scale down your goal in order to achieve it at all. In week 7 we will look at the first interim results. A good moment to look at your own goal again from the SMART perspective and if necessary to readjust it a bit. Example of goal setting with OKRs . As easy as the card box is to explain, as challenging it can be to work with it at the beginning. For this reason, we recommend setting a concrete goal and possibly starting with a small project. To make this a little more concrete, here is an example. Nima has started to study wants to work in science in the future, so clean scientific work and the corresponding writing organization should be practiced from the beginning. Nima's goal for week 12 in the notebox learning path is to develop a routine in using the notebox. Therefore, Nima is considering working on this very routine with an upcoming term paper. For starters, it is very challenging to write 15 pages from the note box, so it makes sense to define even more key outcomes. The question that can help you to define the Key Results is: How do I know that I am getting closer to my Objective? 1st Key Result: The key result that is obvious is the 15 pages written. 2nd Key Result: Nima has developed a complete workflow. This includes a reading routine, transferring notes to permanent notes, linking thoughts,.... **Additional Information. Wikipedia article SMART Criteria (English).

MOCs are entry points to larger subject areas. They are a map to your knowledge with which you can safely orient yourself within a topic area. They allow you to get a quick overview without having to read all the details again. If necessary, you can of course read deeper into the details. As I said, you can get an overview of a topic with a lot of notes by using a MOC and you can also elaborate it more. Think of a MOC as a room where all the notes on a topic can exist without you having to combine them directly in a meaningful way, but you could. You can just create a room in your Zettelkasten that contains all the notes on a topic and you don't have a compulsion to link them directly now in a logical and sequential way. They may all be in there. Now you may ask yourself, when should you create a MOC? You should create a MOC when you have the feeling to lose the overview of a topic. Then it is really high time. An indication could also be if you keep looking for information, but can't find it directly. get all notes about the topic into a new note weigh the notes against each other, work out thoughts, divide, structure. This is where new insights emerge because you are intensely engaged with your thoughts. This process can take several days. You create an overview of the topic based on your notes. Link the MOC in the system and ensure findability Keep in mind that MOCs will continue to evolve, they are not static. As your knowledge grows the time will come to update a MOC. The notes will be weighed against each other again. A MOC can in turn contain several MOCs and thus a whole hierarchy of MOCs on a topic can emerge. Here again the most important points to MOCs - offers entry points to larger topics and helps to get an overview and to work out topics with many notes. - Should be created when there is a feeling of losing track of a topic. - MOCs can evolve - a MOC can contain several MOCs. Tasks/Exercises Choose a topic for which you want to create a MOC. It makes sense to choose a topic for which you have several notes in your Zettelkasten. Gather all your notes on that topic into a new note. Go through all the notes and weigh them against each other. Revise them, reducing them to single ideas and removing unnecessary information. Create a subdividing structure from the remaining notes. (optional) write an overview of the topic. Connect your new MOC to the rest of the note system by tagging it appropriately. Make sure the MOC is easy to find by choosing a meaningful title and adding relevant keywords. (Optional) Consider whether it is possible to further subdivide the topic and if so create appropriate sub-MOCs. Hints: - The process can take a lot of time - It is not necessary to structure the notes hierarchically, experiment with different structures to find the best one for the topic. - It is recommended to practice creating a MOC regularly. Reflection section How did creating the MOC impact my understanding of the topic and what insights did I gain through the process? What were the biggest challenges in collecting my notes on the topic? What type of structure did I choose for my MOC and why? What can I do to ensure that my MOC is easily findable?

New connections, insights and new questions arise from this. It is thought in the note box, or with the note box.

It becomes possible to objectively draw comparisons between parallel and even contradictory thoughts. When a question arises, it is a good approach to search in the first instance in one's own note box, because there is already a high quality of thoughts and selections.

By the way, if you find notes in your slip box that contradict each other, neither is removed. Instead, another note is created that deals with the contradiction, e.g. why it is a contradiction. Whether there are areas where sometimes one is correct , sometimes the other. A contradiction offers the possibility to learn and grow from it. Likewise it leads to the clearer demarcation of the statements. So it is anything but a problem. Tip on structure The way of noting is open.

An established workflow helps to find a habit, use time more effectively, avoid distractions and focus on the task at hand. Habits require less energy and allow you to constantly optimize your work process. A Zettelkasten workflow should include steps such as collecting notes, processing notes, writing permanent notes, creating Map Of Contents, and thinking in the Zettelkasten. When thinking in the Zettelkasten, you should ask questions, find answers, generate new ideas, work systematically with the Zettelkasten, and connect knowledge systematically. To establish a workflow, you should first define a goal, list the tools you use, and put the steps in order. The steps and tools should be connected and the workflow should be reviewed and adjusted regularly to keep it up to date. A workflow stays alive if it is executed, reviewed and adjusted on a regular basis. Regularity in execution and review is important to ensure it is still current and meets your needs.

Maybe you have experienced this in school when you wanted to prepare for a class assignment and went through your notes ;-) Literature Notes The literature note, or bibliographic note, is the reference to the source of the information. The purpose of the bibliographic note is to record the source of the information. Depending on what you expect of yourself, you may want to include more or less information. If you are working scientifically, you will need to include more information, as there are usually general guidelines for this, which we will not go into here. Apart from that, you should always note down the following information - author - Book title/Internet link - date of publication Permanent notes Your thoughts about the information are in the Permanent Notes. Every note you put in your notebox is meant to stay in your notebox forever. Hence permanent. It is irrelevant if you keep rewriting the note with the newest information or if you create new notes with new information and link them. Map of Contents / Index Map of Content or Index notes are entry points on a higher level. Later we will come to how such notes are created. Here it is only about the fact that you already know that such a thing exists. When you have a lot of notes in your system, you will need a method to find your thoughts when you need them. And that's where these Map Of Contents help. By the way, there can be several levels of them, depending on how extensive your thoughts on a topic are. Structure - DNA of a note A structure for notes? Since it is not enough to simply record the thought, but it needs to be coherently \"taken in hand\" in order to creatively stand in (d)context, there is a structure for this. The thought itself is certainly the most important thing in the whole, ultimately it comes from a context and is thought in a new one. Directly following this is the retrievability of the thought. On the one hand you have to grasp it quickly and on the other hand this only happens if you follow the always same structure of the note. This way your brain has accordingly the capacities it needs free to actually grasp the information dynamically. The recognition effect that is in the DNA of your note can actually serve you well.... You can use your own structure. Maybe you already have one you feel comfortable with and want to keep using it. That's perfectly fine. You can also create one according to your own ideas. The important thing is that you stay consistent with it. Changes over time are natural with increasing knowledge. But you should not reinvent your structure every week or even every note ;-) Here is a suggestion for a structure Metadata Here you can enter information like author, source, date, tags and alias. With most PKM programs this information can also be searched and displayed selectively. Thus, the information of the literature note can also be embedded in the metadata. Title Each note needs also a title with which it can be identified unambiguously. Thought Here is the actual note. The thought you have. Knowledge, thoughts, conclusions, what you have in your head. Questions If you ask yourself questions about the thought, you can put them in an extra questions section. This way you can always find your unanswered questions immediately. Footer In the footer could be links to other relevant notes that are not in the text, but still have a relevance to the topic. The source, the literature noitz, could also be placed here. Note in your own words If you can reproduce a thought in your own words, then you have understood the thought. In essence, you can check whether you have acquired the knowledge or not. If you express the thought in your own words and can't find the right words for it, you realize that you didn't understand it after all or maybe you need to practice to improve your performance. If you can express it in your own words, you will already use your own linguistic (or visual) meta-model. All this will most likely guarantee that in a few years you will still be able to express the idea and that it will be understood.

Autor/in: PicoStudio Progressive Summarization Progressive Summarization is a technique to summarize a text in iterative steps and reduce it to the essentials. Ideally, 10% text remains after each iteration. Step 1: the complete text excerpt from a source Step 2: underline or mark in bold the most important statements/sentences of the text Stage 3: From the underlined/bold marked the most important keywords highligted that are important for the statement. Level 4: A summary in your own words Stage 5: Bounding In this process, the original text remains available at all times. If a higher level is not understood, the level below can be read. The method acts much like a safety net. Also, the method can still be used well when not so much energy is available. The method is a method, it does not have to be used.

An important foundation here is the atomicity of notes. Atomicity means that each note refers to exactly one idea. This idea should be elementary and to the point, without prose or unnecessary details. Because of the atomic structure of notes, large ideas or abstract considerations can be created from many small building blocks, or thought processes can be connected. An important component of a note is the title. This should be unique and designed to be as eloquent as possible. In this way, it is already possible to recognize from the title what the note is about and whether it can be useful for the current project. It is recommended to limit the length of the title to ~20 words^[256 characters including file path]. Regarding the length of the note, the text should be kept short to be able to capture the thought quickly. As a guideline, you can use 450 words or a DINA 6 page. In summary, creating notebook-style notes effectively requires: Atomicity: each note should relate to one elementary idea, without prose or unnecessary details. Unique, speaking title: the title should get to the heart of the note's idea and be limited to 20 words if possible. Short text length: the text should be kept short in order to capture the idea quickly, guideline is 450 words or one DINA 6 page. Tasks/Exercises Find a piece of paper that does not fit into the criteria. The criteria are Only one idea on the note? Does the note fit on a DINA6 page (~450 words)? the title reflects the basic idea Rewrite the note so that the criteria are met. divide it into several notes if necessary, one idea per note Delete unnecessary text (prose) Make the title short, concise and meaningful so that it directly reflects the idea. Ideally, it can be used as a sentence directly in a text.

An important foundation here is the atomicity of notes. Atomicity means that each note refers to exactly one idea. This idea should be elementary and to the point, without prose or unnecessary details. Because of the atomic structure of notes, large ideas or abstract considerations can be created from many small building blocks, or thought processes can be connected. An important component of a note is the title. This should be unique and designed to be as eloquent as possible. In this way, it is already possible to recognize from the title what the note is about and whether it can be useful for the current project. It is recommended to limit the length of the title to ~20 words^[256 characters including file path]. Regarding the length of the note, the text should be kept short to be able to capture the thought quickly. As a guideline, you can use 450 words or a DINA 6 page. In summary, creating notebook-style notes effectively requires: Atomicity: each note should relate to one elementary idea, without prose or unnecessary details. Unique, speaking title: the title should get to the heart of the note's idea and be limited to 20 words if possible. Short text length: the text should be kept short in order to capture the idea quickly, guideline is 450 words or one DINA 6 page.","title":"Theory/Questions"},{"location":"2-1-Kata-6/#tasksexercises","text":"Find a piece of paper that does not fit into the criteria.

In the end, we have come from one starting point to a completely different point by chaining. The same thing happens now with linking notes. A thought starts in a note, which leads to another thought (note), and on and on. This is a fundamental aspect of dovetailing, connecting information that has to do with each other. From this connecting of information, clusters of topics emerge. This is what is meant by bottom-up in this context. Areas/topics are not defined in advance, but the topics are formed by the accumulation of knowledge and networking with each other to form topic areas. Thus, branching not only creates topic clusters, but also natural entry points for topics. Connections grow between topics that were not known before. This can lead to new ideas or even completely new approaches: something new emerges. In this way, your knowledge connects itself in your own note box just as it is laid out in the neuronal structure of your brain, and in the process it sinks in deeper and deeper. A piece of information is most likely to be found when there are many links on it. This is predetermined by the system of the brain. You use this when you create your note. Therefore, linking relevant information increases the findability and memorability of the information. Note-taking is also important for this. It keeps the information in the Zettelkasten together and makes it accessible so that you can think and work with it on a deeper level (your long-term memory). It is worth mentioning that the more notes you have in your Zettelkasten, the more important and clear it becomes. Even if you have only a few notes in your notebook, it is worth starting now and repeating them continuously. In total, your notebook will grow on the one hand and the knowledge will be retained or deepened on the other. Tasks/Exercises In the last kata you already made notes more atomic, so now you can grasp the idea of the note more quickly. Go through the notes in your note box and if you notice that two ideas belong together, can look out for each other, or are otherwise connected, link them together.

But your notes are still easy to keep track of. However, if your note box continues to grow, it may start to become confusing. Therefore, it is now a question of how you can find your knowledge in your note box again, if it becomes more and more extensive. An important requirement of your system is the retrievability of information. Retrievability means being able to find information you once stored later when you need it. This contrasts with information retrieval, where you know the information you are looking for is in a specific document and you have to search that document specifically. An important aspect of linking knowledge is the ability to link to notes that fit the topic. Of course, this is most easily done if you remember that you have that information in your Zettelkasten. Otherwise, we are already in the topic, how do you find information back in your note box? Successful knowledge management should therefore originate bottom-up topic oriented and have indexes, or map of content notes, as entry points. This way, you can avoid getting lost in the flood of notes and instead search specifically for information that you had in your head but can no longer name precisely. Or even \"stumbles\" across information that you had \"forgotten\" was in the system. Factors that influence the retrievability of information include the structure and organization of the notes, the use of keywords and tags, the possibility of full-text search, and the use of metadata. One way to improve retrievability is to create indexes or a Map of Content (MOC). This defines major points of contact from which more detailed information can be accessed. Another option is the use of tags to quickly browse topic affiliations. However, the TAGs should be used rather sparingly, too many TAGs can lead to not seeing the forest for the trees. TAGs should also be maintained regularly to remain useful. A full-text search within the notes makes it possible to search specifically for certain terms. By using metadata, such as aliases, authors or book titles, notes can be filtered and sorted specifically. Another way to make notes retrievable is to link them to each other. This makes it easy to move from one topic to the next and keep the information thematically coherent. What emerges in the previous exercise when you get bogged down. Train of thought. Exercise/Task Use keywords and tags: Try to add keywords and tags to the notes in your Zettelkasten to make it easier to identify topics. Create an overview of the keywords and tags you use in your Zettelkasten and think about how you can target them to improve information retrieval. Try out full-text search: Experiment with full-text search within your Zettelkasten to target specific terms. Experiment with how you might navigate along a thread to find information within the thread. Even if you know exactly where the information is, how would you navigate to it if you only knew it was somewhere in the thread?

There are many programs that use proprietary formats. Proprietary formats are formats created by a particular company or developer that can only be used with their products.

Unfortunately, however, there are difficulties and risks associated with using proprietary formats.

Another risk is that the format may eventually be discontinued by the company or developer, which may mean that you can no longer open your notes. The accumulated knowledge is then lost. One solution to this could be to implement a switching strategy. One possibility would be to create all new notes from now on in an open format like Markdown, in a suitable program. If one then later searches for old notes, one can search for them in the old program and then transfer them to the new program. The advantage here would be that the transfer only happens when it is really necessary and the energy is distributed for it.
