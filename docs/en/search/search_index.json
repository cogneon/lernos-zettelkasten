However, knowledge alone is not enough to be successful. It is just as important, if not more important, to think knowledge further in order to combine it into something new. For example, to accomplish tasks and projects more efficiently, to adapt quickly to new demands and challenges, to better understand and pursue goals and plans, or to use study time more efficiently. However, this is easier said than done. Fortunately, there are personal knowledge management methods that can help. One of these methods is the note box method. The notebox method is based on a bottom-up topic structure and aims to put thoughts and ideas in one central place and connect them to each other in order to gain new insights, internalize knowledge and create sound texts. It may take a while to see the first results, but if you use the slip box method continuously, you will benefit from the rich harvest. In order to use the note box method successfully, it is important to use it on a daily basis. Read and jot down your thoughts on what you read. Precisely formulate your notes and link your knowledge together. Connect your ideas and create overlapping connections. Ask yourself questions and try to answer them. Through this continuous thinking in the notebook, you will deepen your knowledge and generate new ideas. In practice, the slip box method can be used in everyday work, study, and personal life. It can help to write well-founded articles, to make extensive thoughts tangible and to deepen your own knowledge. It is also helpful when writing articles, forum posts, social media posts, because you collect thoughts, prepare them and can insert them directly in an outline and have your contributions with depth already 90% ready. Where the method can support you - Professionally - It facilitates efficient and successful completion of tasks and projects. - It supports career development by helping to build and demonstrate relevant knowledge and skills. - It enables faster adaptation to new job demands and challenges. - It increases productivity and the ability to make decisions quickly. - It improves communication and collaboration within the organization. - Private - It helps to better understand and follow one's goals and plans. - It supports self-organization and enables better management of time and tasks. - It promotes personal and intellectual development by helping to build new knowledge and skills. - It enables better management of finances and resources. - It increases the ability to solve problems and make decisions more quickly and effectively. - In studies - It supports the understanding and retention of learning content and facilitates preparation for exams. - It promotes the development of self-learning strategies and the ability to acquire knowledge independently. - It enables more efficient use of study time and resources. - It promotes the ability to make connections between different subjects and disciplines. - It increases opportunities for successful career and professional development. The slip box method was developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann (*8.12.1927), who was able to publish about 70 books and 400 articles with its help. And all of them of high quality. He used his slip box analog. What do you think he could have accomplished with a digital slip box? Find out what you can achieve!

For example, to accomplish tasks and projects more efficiently, to adapt quickly to new demands and challenges, to better understand and pursue goals and plans, or to use study time more efficiently. However, this is easier said than done. Fortunately, there are personal knowledge management methods that can help. One of these methods is the note box method. The notebox method is based on a bottom-up topic structure and aims to put thoughts and ideas in one central place and connect them to each other in order to gain new insights, internalize knowledge and create sound texts. It may take a while to see the first results, but if you use the slip box method continuously, you will benefit from the rich harvest. In order to use the note box method successfully, it is important to use it on a daily basis. Read and jot down your thoughts on what you read. Precisely formulate your notes and link your knowledge together. Connect your ideas and create overlapping connections. Ask yourself questions and try to answer them. Through this continuous thinking in the notebook, you will deepen your knowledge and generate new ideas. In practice, the slip box method can be used in everyday work, study, and personal life. It can help to write well-founded articles, to make extensive thoughts tangible and to deepen your own knowledge. It is also helpful when writing articles, forum posts, social media posts, because you collect thoughts, prepare them and can insert them directly in an outline and have your contributions with depth already 90% ready. Where the method can support you - Professionally - It facilitates efficient and successful completion of tasks and projects. - It supports career development by helping to build and demonstrate relevant knowledge and skills. - It enables faster adaptation to new job demands and challenges. - It increases productivity and the ability to make decisions quickly. - It improves communication and collaboration within the organization. - Private - It helps to better understand and follow one's goals and plans. - It supports self-organization and enables better management of time and tasks. - It promotes personal and intellectual development by helping to build new knowledge and skills. - It enables better management of finances and resources. - It increases the ability to solve problems and make decisions more quickly and effectively. - In studies - It supports the understanding and retention of learning content and facilitates preparation for exams. - It promotes the development of self-learning strategies and the ability to acquire knowledge independently. - It enables more efficient use of study time and resources. - It promotes the ability to make connections between different subjects and disciplines. - It increases opportunities for successful career and professional development. The slip box method was developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann (*8.12.1927), who was able to publish about 70 books and 400 articles with its help. And all of them of high quality. He used his slip box analog. What do you think he could have accomplished with a digital slip box?

You can choose a goal that is really, really important to you and with which you will make very concrete progress during the sprint. However, especially for PKM beginners, achieving the goal is not the top priority. In addition to learning the basic knowledge, the environment, the findability and permanence of notes, the focus is still very much on regularly applying the newly gained skills. In particular and last but not least, one main thing is our focus: having a lot of fun! :D To ensure optimal learning success, it is important to set goals that motivate you and make your progress tangible and visible. You'll want to set your goals using the SMART formula or use Google's OKR method^[links in the \"More Information\" section] to define your goal. Consider whether you might want to work toward a specific product. This could be, for example, a blog article for your co-workers, or a first publication, or, or, or.... Visualize your goal. For this purpose, you can use different technical tools on the Internet. Think about how you will share your progress in the Circle. In other words, if your first priority is to check-in, that's a bit low. Consider what documentation tools are out there that are good for logging your progress. Define goals using the SMART formula. Autor: Dmitry Using the SMART method is a good way to define a goal. It applies various criteria against which the goal definition is measured. This way you have the guarantee to reach a smart goal. S pecific: Is it really clear what you want to do, or are you perhaps too vague in your wording? What is included, and especially what is not? Only if you really know exactly what you want to do and at the same time know the limits of your intention, you can set out and be sure that you will arrive on the way in any case without getting bogged down or even losing your orientation. M essbar: What must have happened so that you can say that your goal has been achieved. What work result is there then? For example, if you want to get \"better\" at something, what do you need to do and how often to get enough practice? Formulate in such a conclusive and measurable way that you can achieve just that. Essentially, ask yourself what you want to get better at or what exactly this \"better\" can be tied to. Characterize the first point, because the more specific you are in defining your goal, the more likely you are to get a result that meets your expectations, that can be further improved, and that can be markedly evaluated. A ttractive: Your goal must motivate you. You must want to achieve it if you want to spend 12 weeks to make it come true. Therefore, this point is especially important. It should be a goal that you have personally chosen for yourself and with which you can identify 100%. A goal that others set for me will rarely trigger the same desire in me to achieve it as one that springs from my own heart. In some explanations of the SMART formula, the A also stands for A nchallenging. Will mean that your goal should not be too easy. You should make a little effort and challenge yourself, because if you stay too far away from your personal limits and actually still chill in your comfort zone, you can rarely really improve. Ultimately, you need to go a little beyond your comfort zone without completely overtaxing yourself, because that's where growth begins. Caution. Overextending yourself won't yield sustainable results, and by and large, this learning path is meant to bring one thing above all else: a lot of fun! And that can quickly fall by the wayside if your goals are too ambitious. R ealistic: The learning path goes 12 weeks and therefore you should also choose a goal that is really achievable in this time. Stay down to earth when defining your goals. You can achieve anything at a snail's pace and with perseverance. It is also key to question yourself in advance: Are you one of those people who like to choose their goals a little more challenging? How much time do you really have available each week? Does the whole thing really fit into the framework of the 12 weeks of the Learning Sprint? If it has to be, then say goodbye to one or the other idea for the time being. Ultimately, the first sprint is good training that will eventually become second nature. The current learning sprint may only have been a prelude. :-) T erminated: Another important requirement of your goal that you should pay attention to is the date of completion. In the context of the learning sprint, this date can actually be determined very precisely. And that's important, too, because it gives you the opportunity to check whether you're still on track in terms of deliverables, open items, and any problems or obstacles, or whether you might need to put more energy into your work on the project or conclusively scale down your goal in order to achieve it at all. In week 7 we will look at the first interim results. A good moment to look at your own goal again from the SMART perspective and if necessary to readjust it a bit. Example of goal setting with OKRs . As easy as the card box is to explain, as challenging it can be to work with it at the beginning. For this reason, we recommend setting a concrete goal and possibly starting with a small project. To make this a little more concrete, here is an example. Nima has started to study wants to work in science in the future, so clean scientific work and the corresponding writing organization should be practiced from the beginning. Nima's goal for week 12 in the notebox learning path is to develop a routine in using the notebox. Therefore, Nima is considering working on this very routine with an upcoming term paper. For starters, it is very challenging to write 15 pages from the note box, so it makes sense to define even more key outcomes. The question that can help you to define the Key Results is: How do I know that I am getting closer to my Objective? 1st Key Result: The key result that is obvious is the 15 pages written. 2nd Key Result: Nima has developed a complete workflow.

But your notes are still easy to keep track of. However, if your note box continues to grow, it may start to become confusing. Therefore, it is now a question of how you can find your knowledge in your note box again, if it becomes more and more extensive. An important requirement of your system is the retrievability of information. Retrievability means being able to find information you once stored later when you need it. This contrasts with information retrieval, where you know the information you are looking for is in a specific document and you have to search that document specifically. An important aspect of linking knowledge is the ability to link to notes that fit the topic. Of course, this is most easily done if you remember that you have that information in your Zettelkasten. Otherwise, we are already in the topic, how do you find information back in your note box? Successful knowledge management should therefore originate bottom-up topic oriented and have indexes, or Map Of Content (MOC) notes, as entry points. This way, you can avoid getting lost in the flood of notes and instead search specifically for information that you had in your head but can no longer name precisely. Or even \"stumbles\" across information that you had \"forgotten\" was in the system. Factors that influence the retrievability of information include the structure and organization of the notes, the use of keywords and tags, the possibility of full-text search, and the use of metadata. One way to improve retrievability is to create indexes or a Map of Content (MOC). This defines major points of contact from which more detailed information can be accessed. Another option is the use of tags to quickly browse topic affiliations. However, the TAGs should be used rather sparingly, too many TAGs can lead to not seeing the forest for the trees. TAGs should also be maintained regularly to remain useful. A full-text search within the notes makes it possible to search specifically for certain terms. By using metadata, such as aliases, authors or book titles, notes can be filtered and sorted specifically. Another way to make notes retrievable is to link them to each other. This makes it easy to move from one topic to the next and keep the information thematically coherent. What emerges in the previous exercise when you get bogged down. Train of thought. Exercise Use keywords and tags: Try to add keywords and tags to the notes in your Zettelkasten to make it easier to identify topics. Create an overview of the keywords and tags you use in your Zettelkasten and think about how you can target them to improve information retrieval. Try out full-text search: Experiment with full-text search within your Zettelkasten to target specific terms.

As I said, you can get an overview of a topic with a lot of notes by using a MOC and you can also elaborate it more. Think of a MOC as a room where all the notes on a topic can exist without you having to combine them directly in a meaningful way, but you could. You can just create a room in your Zettelkasten that contains all the notes on a topic and you don't have a compulsion to link them directly now in a logical and sequential way. They may all be in there. Now you may ask yourself, when should you create a MOC? Nick Milo has some helpful advice here and also immediately suggested a method we use here. You should create a MOC when you have the feeling to lose the overview of a topic. Then it is really high time. An indication could also be if you keep looking for information, but can't find it directly. get all notes about the topic into a new note weigh the notes against each other, work out thoughts, divide, structure. This is where new insights emerge because you are intensely engaged with your thoughts. This process can take several days. You create an overview of the topic based on your notes. Link the MOC in the system and ensure findability Keep in mind that MOCs will continue to evolve, they are not static. As your knowledge grows the time will come to update a MOC. The notes will be weighed against each other again. A MOC can in turn contain several MOCs and thus a whole hierarchy of MOCs on a topic can emerge. Here again the most important points to MOCs - offers entry points to larger topics and helps to get an overview and to work out topics with many notes. - Should be created when there is a feeling of losing track of a topic. - MOCs can evolve - a MOC can contain several MOCs. Exercises Choose a topic for which you want to create a MOC. It makes sense to choose a topic for which you have several notes in your Zettelkasten. Gather all your notes on that topic into a new note. Go through all the notes and weigh them against each other. Revise them, reducing them to single ideas and removing unnecessary information. Create a subdividing structure from the remaining notes. (optional) write an overview of the topic. Connect your new MOC to the rest of the note system by tagging it appropriately. Make sure the MOC is easy to find by choosing a meaningful title and adding relevant keywords. (Optional) Consider whether it is possible to further subdivide the topic and if so create appropriate sub-MOCs. Hints: - The process can take a lot of time - It is not necessary to structure the notes hierarchically, experiment with different structures to find the best one for the topic. - It is recommended to practice creating a MOC regularly.

An established workflow helps to find a habit, use time more effectively, avoid distractions and focus on the task at hand. Habits require less energy and allow you to constantly optimize your work process. A Zettelkasten workflow should include steps such as collecting notes, processing notes, writing permanent notes, creating Map Of Contents, and thinking in the Zettelkasten. When thinking in the Zettelkasten, you should ask questions, find answers, generate new ideas, work systematically with the Zettelkasten, and connect knowledge systematically. To establish a workflow, you should first define a goal, list the tools you use, and put the steps in order. The steps and tools should be connected and the workflow should be reviewed and adjusted regularly to keep it up to date. A workflow stays alive if it is executed, reviewed and adjusted on a regular basis. Regularity in execution and review is important to ensure it is still current and meets your needs. Adjustments should therefore be made regularly to keep it up to date. Here are sample workflows to inspire you. Everything is allowed, so you can have completely different entry points.

The purpose of the bibliographic note is to record the source of the information. Depending on what you expect of yourself, you may want to include more or less information. If you are working scientifically, you will need to include more information, as there are usually general guidelines for this, which we will not go into here. Apart from that, you should always note down the following information - author - Book title/Internet link - date of publication Permanent notes Your thoughts about the information are in the Permanent Notes. Every note you put in your notebox is meant to stay in your notebox forever. Hence permanent. It is irrelevant if you keep rewriting the note with the newest information or if you create new notes with new information and link them. Map of Contents / Index Map of Content or Index notes are entry points on a higher level. Later (in week 8 ) we will come to how such notes are created. Here it is only about the fact that you already know that such a thing exists. When you have a lot of notes in your system, you will need a method to find your thoughts when you need them. And that's where these Map Of Contents help. By the way, there can be several levels of them, depending on how extensive your thoughts on a topic are. Structure - DNA of a note A structure for notes? Since it is not enough to simply record the thought, but it needs to be coherently \"taken in hand\" in order to creatively stand in (d)context, there is a structure for this. The thought itself is certainly the most important thing in the whole, ultimately it comes from a context and is thought in a new one. Directly following this is the retrievability of the thought. On the one hand you have to grasp it quickly and on the other hand this only happens if you follow the always same structure of the note. This way your brain has accordingly the capacities it needs free to actually grasp the information dynamically. The recognition effect that is in the DNA of your note can actually serve you well.... You can use your own structure. Maybe you already have one you feel comfortable with and want to keep using it. That's perfectly fine. You can also create one according to your own ideas. The important thing is that you stay consistent with it. Changes over time are natural with increasing knowledge. But you should not reinvent your structure every week or even every note ;-) Here is a suggestion for a structure Metadata Here you can enter information like author, source, date, tags and alias. With most PKM programs this information can also be searched and displayed selectively. Thus, the information of the literature note can also be embedded in the metadata. Title Each note needs also a title with which it can be identified unambiguously. Thought Here is the actual note. The thought you have. Knowledge, thoughts, conclusions, what you have in your head. Questions If you ask yourself questions about the thought, you can put them in an extra questions section. This way you can always find your unanswered questions immediately. Footer In the footer could be links to other relevant notes that are not in the text, but still have a relevance to the topic. The source, the literature noitz, could also be placed here. Note in your own words If you can reproduce a thought in your own words, then you have understood the thought. In essence, you can check whether you have acquired the knowledge or not. If you express the thought in your own words and can't find the right words for it, you realize that you didn't understand it after all or maybe you need to practice to improve your performance. If you can express it in your own words, you will already use your own linguistic (or visual) meta-model. All this will most likely guarantee that in a few years you will still be able to express the idea and that it will be understood. This topic will be discussed again in detail in the kata Creating durable notes .

By taking time to regularly create and process notes, you can continuously increase your knowledge. Often it is enough to create a few, but regular notes. Every note, every linking of notes, and the thoughts that arise from them contribute to the increase of your knowledge. It is important to understand that knowledge management is a marathon and not a sprint, so you should also take time to take small steps. To make note-taking easier and more energy-efficient, it's helpful to establish routines. You can do this, for example, by setting specific days or times when you create and process notes. Fleeting notes, such as those created during a meeting or lecture, should be processed as quickly as possible to help you remember them later. The shorter the interval between the creation of the note and its processing, the better you can remember it later. To create your first note in the note box, you can use the information from Week 3 (Getting to Know Notes). The topic of your first note is not that important, it should just be something that interests you but is not so important that it paralyzes you. It's perfectly fine to create multiple notes and link them - try it out and see how it works for you. Tip If you're unsure about what information to include in your Zettelkasten, you can check the information against the following criteria: - the information speaks to me - the information makes me think - I need the information for a topic I am working on. If necessary, look again at week 3 - Getting to Know Notes . Tip 2 To create links in Mark-Down just put [[ ]] around the note name and it becomes a link. Here you fan find more MarkDown formating . Exercises Create note(s) Read an article/book/topic that you are currently interested in and create note(s) from it.

An important foundation here is the atomicity of notes. Atomicity means that each note refers to exactly one idea. This idea should be elementary and to the point, without prose or unnecessary details. Because of the atomic structure of notes, large ideas or abstract considerations can be created from many small building blocks, or thought processes can be connected. An important component of a note is the title. This should be unique and designed to be as eloquent as possible. In this way, it is already possible to recognize from the title what the note is about and whether it can be useful for the current project. It is recommended to limit the length of the title to ~20 words^[256 characters including file path]. Regarding the length of the note, the text should be kept short to be able to capture the thought quickly. As a guideline, you can use 450 words or a DINA 6 page. In summary, creating notebook-style notes effectively requires: Atomicity: each note should relate to one elementary idea, without prose or unnecessary details. Unique, speaking title: the title should get to the heart of the note's idea and be limited to 20 words if possible. Short text length: the text should be kept short in order to capture the idea quickly, guideline is 450 words or one DINA 6 page. Exercises Find a piece of paper that does not fit into the criteria.

In the end, we have come from one starting point to a completely different point by chaining. The same thing happens now with linking notes. A thought starts in a note, which leads to another thought (note), and on and on. This is a fundamental aspect of dovetailing, connecting information that has to do with each other. From this connecting of information, clusters of topics emerge. This is what is meant by bottom-up in this context. Areas/topics are not defined in advance, but the topics are formed by the accumulation of knowledge and networking with each other to form topic areas. Thus, not only topic clusters but also natural entry points for topics are created by the divergence. Connections grow between topics that were not known before. This can lead to new ideas or even completely new approaches: something new emerges. In this way, your knowledge connects in your own notebook just as it is laid out in the neuronal structure of your brain, and in the process it sinks in deeper and deeper. A piece of information is best found when there are many links on it. This is predetermined by the brain's system. You use this when you create your note. Therefore, linking relevant information increases the findability and memorability of the information. Note-taking is also important for this. It keeps the information in the Zettelkasten together and makes it accessible so that you can think and work with it on a deeper level (your long-term memory). The more notes you have in your box, the more important and clear it becomes. Even if you only have a few notes in your Zettelkasten, it's worth starting now so that it grows. This way you will save knowledge and deepen it at the same time. Exercises In the last kata, you already made notes more atomic, so now you can capture the idea of the note more quickly. Go through the notes in your Zettelkasten and if you notice that two ideas belong together, can look out for each other, or are otherwise connected, link them together. If questions come to mind as you read the note, look for answers in your Zettelkasten and link them if you find notes that match. Break down other notes into smaller components (keyword atomicity, from Kata 8 ), linking them as you go, as soon as you get the impression that they should be related. You can also create direct links to other notes that you know are related when adding permanent notes. You can put the link in the Footer^[The bottom area of a note] area, or you can link inline^[Insert directly into the text or sentence]. And keep in mind, a link is not only to the same topics, but can also be a completely new link, just the one you see. You could also create a new note explaining for yourself why you see a connection between the two notes. The following image illustrates this. Note: If you are working a lot and intensively on a topic, it might make sense to set up an additional time per week where you only focus on linking ideas to each other.

There are many programs that use proprietary formats. Proprietary formats are formats created by a particular company or developer that can only be used with their products. An example of this would be the format of a note in the Evernote app that cannot be opened in other note apps. Unfortunately, however, there are difficulties and risks associated with using proprietary formats. One of them is that you are trapped in a dependency on a particular company or developer, since you cannot change or export the format without using the corresponding product. Another risk is that the format may eventually be discontinued by the company or developer, which may mean that you can no longer open your notes. The accumulated knowledge is then lost. One solution to this could be to implement a switching strategy. One possibility would be to create all new notes from now on in an open format like Markdown, in a suitable program. If one then later searches for old notes, one can search for them in the old program and then transfer them to the new program. The advantage here would be that the transfer only happens when it is really necessary and the energy is distributed for it. Another suggestion for a switch strategy could be to look for tools that can convert the proprietary format to an open format like Markdown.
