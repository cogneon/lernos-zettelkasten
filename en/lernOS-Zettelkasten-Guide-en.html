<p>lernOS is a method of self-organization for people living and working
in the 21st century. To be successful today, you need to be constantly
learning, organizing and developing. No one else is responsible for this
process. You have to take care of it yourself (self-directed, lifelong
learning).</p>

class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Lifelong learning and knowledge
work</h2>
<p>We are currently in a very dynamic transition from an industrial to a
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wissensgesellschaft">knowledge
society</a>: Characteristic of this is that rules and norms are
continuously questioned through learning processes (see also <a
href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283061140_Merkmale_der_Wissensgesellschaft">Characteristics
of the knowledge society</a>).</p>
<p>In this society, we as individuals can actually only be successful
through learning and contribute to the well-being of all together with
others.</p>
<p><img src="images/LebenslangesLernen.jpeg" alt="Lifelong learning" />
Author: geschmacksRaum®</p>
<p>Learning is the intentional or incidental acquisition of knowledge or
skills. This learning process leads to relatively stable changes in
behavior, thinking or feeling, based on experience or new knowledge.</p>
<p>In 1996, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delors_Report">Delors Report</a> of
the European Commission drew an overall picture of lifelong learning
(“learning throughout life”) and named the four pillars that should be
integrated into education and training in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learning to know</strong> - a broad general knowledge with
the possibility to deepen a small number of topics.</li>
<li><strong>Learning to do</strong> - to acquire not only professional
skills, but also the competence to deal with many situations and to work
in teams.</li>
<li><strong>Learning to be</strong> - to develop one’s own personality
and to be able to act with growing autonomy, judgment and personal
responsibility.</li>
<li><strong>Learning to live together</strong> - by developing an
understanding of other people and an appreciation of
interdependence.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are also very practical reasons that make lifelong learning
necessary for you. As you can see from the <a
href="http://www.online-lehrbuch-bwl.de/lehrbuch/kap3/oe_le/oe_le.pdf">half-life
of knowledge</a> graph, some types of knowledge quickly become outdated,
making continuous learning simply necessary. Even if areas such as
school knowledge remain reasonably stable, the need to learn new things
- especially in the technology and IT sectors - is particularly
great.</p>

</figure>
<p>For the citizens of a society, this means that even after completing
their education through school and university, they should continue to
learn in order not to lose touch. This learning process, which extends
from birth to death, is referred to as lifelong or <a
href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebenslanges_Lernen">lifelong
learning</a>.</p>
<p>Until the first education, in most cases not only the parents but
also the state take care of learning and education. After that, you have
to <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selbstorganisation">organize
it for yourself</a>. <img
src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117161147/205277408-e05ec31a-ee9b-439c-af25-f6fceab19955.jpeg"

<h3 data-number="1.1.1" id="knowledge-work"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Knowledge work</h3>
<p>In his book Landmarks of Tomorrow, Peter Drucker points to a change
in the world of work toward knowledge-intensive work tasks, or <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker">knowledge
work</a>, as early as the late 1950s. The knowledge worker is
characterized by the fact that he knows better about the work task and
the necessary knowledge than the managers of the organization, and
therefore - in contrast to <a
href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylorismus">Taylorism</a> or <a
href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Management">Scientific
Management</a>, in which there is a separation between head work and
manual work - organizes himself to the greatest possible extent.</p>
<p>The organizational sociologist Hellmut Willke <a
href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41011087_Organisierte_Wissensarbeit">defines
knowledge work</a> as activities such as communication, transaction and
interaction, which are characterized by the fact that they require
knowledge that has not been acquired once in life, for example through
experience, initiation, teaching, specialized training or
professionalization, and can then be continuously applied. Instead, it
is precisely the knowledge that emerges in the lifelong learning process
that is charaketistic and action-guiding for knowledge work. For this
reason, relevant knowledge is not static, but should be</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Continuously revised,</li>
<li>permanently regarded as capable of improvement</li>
<li>in principle not be regarded as truth, but as a resource, and</li>
<li>be inseparably coupled with non-knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, knowledge work involves risks, because what is valid today
may already be invalid tomorrow.</p>
<p>The following activities are considered particularly
knowledge-intensive, according to the study <a
href="https://lit.bibb.de/vufind/Record/DS-131131">Activities and
occupational requirements in knowledge-intensive occupations</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Developing</li>
<li>Researching</li>
<li>Documenting</li>
<li>Training</li>
<li>Teaching</li>
<li>Organizing other people’s workflows (yes, managers and executives
are knowledge workers too :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>If your workday consists largely of one or more of these activities,
you can count yourself among the knowledge workers and you belong to the
core target group of this guide.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.1.2" id="productivity-of-knowledge-work"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Productivity of knowledge
work</h3>
<p>Productivity](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produktivit%C3%A4t) is
classically defined as the ratio of products produced to the factors of
production required to produce them. Peter Drucker, in the book
Management Challenges for the 21st Century, summarizes knowledge worker
productivity in six factors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>knowledge worker productivity requires that the first thing we ask
ourselves is <strong>what is the task?</strong></li>
<li>knowledge work requires us to transfer responsibility for
productivity to individual knowledge workers; to do this, we must give
them the benefit of the doubt, because <strong>knowledge workers must
manage themselves.</strong> To do this, there must be autonomous room
for maneuver.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous innovation</strong> is a part of the work that is
the task and responsibility of knowledge workers.</li>
<li>knowledge work goes hand in hand with <strong>continuous
learning</strong> on the one hand and <strong>continuous
teaching</strong> by knowledge workers on the other hand.</li>
<li>the <strong>productivity of the knowledge worker</strong> is
primarily not a question of the quantity of the results. The devil is
often in the details, so quality is at least as important.</li>
<li>in conclusion, the productivity of knowledge workers requires that
<strong>knowledge workers are an “asset”</strong> and not a “cost
factor” and are treated accordingly. Knowledge workers are consequently
especially productive when they want to work for the organization and do
not choose one of the many elective options.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dan Pink’s well-received TED talk demonstrates precisely this
connection of the importance of autonomy, continuous learning (mastery),
and independent exploration or figuring out a relevant work task
(purpose) that characterizes work in the 21st century <a

class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Your lernOS Canvas - Overview
of knowledge and learning needs</h2>
<p>With this canvas you can plan your learning and keep a good overview,
so you don’t forget anything important. The visual structure also makes
it easier for you to review the individual components that make up your
current knowledge and learning needs and to match existing resources
with your learning needs. A picture is worth a thousand words! For
example, you can use it to work on several areas at the same time.</p>
<p>Alex Osterwalder was the first to come up with the idea for a lernOS
Canvas. He also developed the [Business Model Canvas
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas), which is used for
the development of business models. Both follow the same basic structure
and should be filled out by you as a start. This way you get a suitable
overview. The <a

<p>In the upper part of the canvas you can enter your name and the date
of creation or last change. If you want to work with the canvas
electronically, you can copy it e.g. into OneNote or a digital
whiteboard. For the first filling of the Canvas, you can ask yourself
the following questions, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose &amp; Purpose:</strong> What do you live for? What
do you want to achieve in your life?</li>
<li><strong>Goals &amp; Key Results:</strong> What are your goals for
the next 12 weeks? What are the measurable outcomes to the goals?</li>
<li><strong>My Roles:</strong> What are your current roles? What are the
goals that flow from them?</li>
<li><strong>My Tasks:</strong> What are your current tasks? What are the
goals that result from them?</li>
<li><strong>My Projects:</strong> What are your current projects? What
are the goals that result from these?</li>
<li><strong>My Social Networks:</strong> What internal and external
social networks (digital and analog) help you network?</li>
<li><strong>My Learning and Working Environment:</strong> What does your
learning and working environment look like (infrastructure, content,
tools, methods, etc.)?</li>
<li><strong>My Knowledge &amp; Skills:</strong> What knowledge areas and
skills are important to your goals, roles, tasks, and projects? What do
you still need to learn?</li>
<li><strong>My Knowledge Assets:</strong> What knowledge assets
(documents, checklists, videos, etc.) do you have? Which of these can
you offer to your network?</li>

class="header-section-number">1.3</span> lernOS Flow - Workflow for
modern working and learning</h2>
<p>Flow](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(Psychologie)) refers to the
feeling of a mental state experienced as blissful, in which you are
concentrated and completely absorbed in an activity. In flow, there is a
good balance between the demands of the activity and one’s own
abilities, so that there is neither overload nor underload. In order to
bring concentration and focus together in our fast and complex world of
life and work, you need a good system for this, with which you are able
to organize yourself.</p>
<p>For the lernOS Flow are therefore on 13-week cycles, which are called
<strong>lernOS Sprints</strong> in the style of <a
href="https://scrumguides.org">Scrum</a>. Each sprint begins with
planning and goal setting (week 0) and ends with a retrospective (week
12). The four quarters of a year are a good rhythm, but you can adapt
this to your preference.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/lernOS-Sprint.png" alt="lernOS Sprint" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">lernOS Sprint</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The lernOS Flow is a workflow that knowledge workers and lifelong
learners can use for their self-organization. For this purpose,
practice-proven methods and approaches are used:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Objectives &amp; Key Results (OKR)</strong> for
goal-oriented and focused work and learning by defining learning
objectives and desired outcomes (see also <a
href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/">OKR</a>
at Google).</li>
<li><strong>Getting Things Done (GTD)</strong> for productive and
stress-free working and learning by structuring self-organization
through a 5-step process (see also <a
href="https://gettingthingsdone.com">GTD</a> by David Allen).</li>
<li><strong>Working Out Loud (WOL)</strong> for openly sharing work
results across the network and telling backstories (see also <a
href="https://thebryceswrite.com/2010/11/29/when-will-we-work-out-loud-soon/">WOL
Definition</a> by Bryce Williams, <a
href="https://workingoutloud.com/de/fur-dich">WOL Circle Guides</a> by
John Stepper).</li>
</ol>
<p>In the lernOS Flow diagram, you can see the elements from each method
by the color coding (OKR: red, GTD: green, WOL: blue):</p>
<p><img src="./images/lernOS-for-You-Flow.png" /></p>
<p>The image is best read from left to right. There are two possible
starting points (green circles) and one end point (red circle). With the
lower starting point, one is more concerned with the short-term and
operational handling of knowledge and learning. The upper starting point
maps the long-term and strategic perspective (see also <a
href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2011/01/the-6-horizons-of-focus/">GTD
- The 6 Horizons of Focus</a>).</p>
<p><strong>ProTip:</strong> if you work privately or professionally with
Microsoft 365, you will find the Microsoft 365 edition of the lernOS
flow in the appendix.</p>

Learning Environment and Knowledge Workplace</h2>
<p>When thinking of the modern learning and knowledge workplace, many
immediately think of the “Digital Workplace” or the “Digital Classroom”
with its many digital tools. That is why this chapter is preceded by the
following quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fool with a tool is still a fool (Ron Weinstein)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mindset, skillset &amp; toolset instead of just toolset: When
designing your own learning environment or knowledge workplace, it is
important to take a balanced view of three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mindset</strong> - What is my mindset towards learning and
how does that show up in my learning environment/knowledge workplace
(see also Growth Mindset by Carol Dweck, Open Mindset by Gary
Hamel)?</li>
<li><strong>Skillset</strong> - how good are my competencies and skills
related to learning (see also (<a

<p>Your <strong>learnOS Workplace</strong> is a very individual matter,
so you should design it as well as possible according to your needs. As
a rule, this place is not only in one place, but in several. For
students, this can be the school and their own room, for example. In
times of distributed and mobile work, any place can be your learning and
working place.</p>
<p>With the following template based on the <a
href="https://jarche.com/2014/02/the-seek-sense-share-framework/">Seek&gt;Sense&gt;Share
Frameworks</a> by Harold Jarche you can describe your current lernOS
Workplace, share your thoughts about it and develop ideas for the
future:</p>

environment: all learners have to choose and set up appropriate
tools.</p>

of the learners</h2>
<p>The individual knowledge and learning environments are just as
individual as every single person is. The idea of lernOS Memex aims to
create a common reference point here. Memex stands for “Memory Extender”
and can be understood as a digital twin of one’s own brain, also called
“second brain”. So that is what this learning path is about among other
things.</p>
<p>The Memex in lernOS is a system that the user trusts and which, in
addition to all the organizational and planning elements of lernOS, also
contains references and descriptions to all other systems used in lernOS
practice.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the Memex can also be implemented in analog form,
e.g., in the form of a notebook. In practice, however, digital notebooks
or scratchpads are mostly used (e.g. Obsidian, Logseq, Roam), as they
offer many advantages over analog variants. For example, they offer
unlimited space, can be searched, and contain audio and video content.
More on this in the learning path itself.</p>

<h1 data-number="2" id="personal-knowledge-management-basics"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Personal Knowledge Management
Basics</h1>
<p>In today’s world, it is more important than ever to constantly
acquire new knowledge and information. However, knowledge alone is not
enough to be successful. It is just as important, if not more important,
to think knowledge further in order to combine it into something new.
For example, to accomplish tasks and projects more efficiently, to adapt
quickly to new demands and challenges, to better understand and pursue
goals and plans, or to use study time more efficiently. However, this is
easier said than done. Fortunately, there are personal knowledge
management methods that can help. One of these methods is the note box
method.</p>
<p>The notebox method is based on a bottom-up topic structure and aims
to put thoughts and ideas in one central place and connect them to each
other in order to gain new insights, internalize knowledge and create
sound texts. It may take a while to see the first results, but if you
use the slip box method continuously, you will benefit from the rich
harvest.</p>
<p>In order to use the note box method successfully, it is important to
use it on a daily basis. Read and jot down your thoughts on what you
read. Precisely formulate your notes and link your knowledge together.
Connect your ideas and create overlapping connections. Ask yourself
questions and try to answer them. Through this continuous thinking in
the notebook, you will deepen your knowledge and generate new ideas.</p>
<p>In practice, the slip box method can be used in everyday work, study,
and personal life. It can help to write well-founded articles, to make
extensive thoughts tangible and to deepen your own knowledge. It is also
helpful when writing articles, forum posts, social media posts, because
you collect thoughts, prepare them and can insert them directly in an
outline and have your contributions with depth already 90% ready.</p>
<p>Where the method can support you - Professionally - It facilitates
efficient and successful completion of tasks and projects. - It supports
career development by helping to build and demonstrate relevant
knowledge and skills. - It enables faster adaptation to new job demands
and challenges. - It increases productivity and the ability to make
decisions quickly. - It improves communication and collaboration within
the organization. - Private - It helps to better understand and follow
one’s goals and plans. - It supports self-organization and enables
better management of time and tasks. - It promotes personal and
intellectual development by helping to build new knowledge and skills. -
It enables better management of finances and resources. - It increases
the ability to solve problems and make decisions more quickly and
effectively. - In studies - It supports the understanding and retention
of learning content and facilitates preparation for exams. - It promotes
the development of self-learning strategies and the ability to acquire
knowledge independently. - It enables more efficient use of study time
and resources. - It promotes the ability to make connections between
different subjects and disciplines. - It increases opportunities for
successful career and professional development.</p>
<p>The slip box method was developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann
(*8.12.1927), who was able to publish about 70 books and 400 articles
with its help. And all of them of high quality. He used his slip box
analog. What do you think he could have accomplished with a digital slip
box? Find out what you can achieve!</p>

<p>If you don’t know each other in the Circle yet, get to know each
other in week 0. Plan when you will meet, what tools you will use to
share, and who will be the moderator.</p>
<p>Define a Circle facilitator who will handle event and time
management. One of the biggest obstacles to successful Circle is
discipline and time management. The moderator is not the “boss*in” of
the Circle, but a normal Circle member who takes care of a smooth event.
Define the day and time of the weekly meeting. Define whether you will
meet in person or virtually. Define the tools you will use for
communication and documentation in the Circle. Decide which of the
suggested exercises you will do in the Circle and as homework. If
necessary, define rules or behavioral labels that are helpful to
you.</p>

<li>Where do we share the results? Do we use social media channels?</li>
<li>Dealing with appointments where not all can attend (e.g. if 3

<li>Attitude, principles for the Circle (e.g. the Circle should be fun!
If you can’t complete a task because you have other priorities that
week, that’s totally ok. We don’t create additional stress)?</li>
</ul>
<p>A very important function of the Circle is to get feedback on your
goals, understanding and workflow and to give feedback to the others. To
help you understand each other better in the process, take a moment to
talk about your idea of constructive feedback. This includes the
question “Why are you doing knowledge management?” and the principle
“Compare yourself to yourself.</p>

<p>What do you want to achieve in the next twelve weeks? You can choose
a goal that is really, really important to you and with which you will
make very concrete progress during the sprint. However, especially for
PKM beginners, achieving the goal is not the top priority. In addition
to learning the basic knowledge, the environment, the findability and
permanence of notes, the focus is still very much on regularly applying
the newly gained skills. In particular and last but not least, one main
thing is our focus: having a lot of fun! :D</p>
<p>To ensure optimal learning success, it is important to set goals that
motivate you and make your progress tangible and visible. You’ll want to
set your goals using the SMART formula or use Google’s OKR method<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> to define your goal. Consider
whether you might want to work toward a specific product. This could be,
for example, a blog article for your co-workers, or a first publication,
or, or, or…. Visualize your goal. For this purpose, you can use
different technical tools on the Internet.</p>
<p>Think about how you will share your progress in the Circle. In other
words, if your first priority is to check-in, that’s a bit low. Consider
what documentation tools are out there that are good for logging your
progress.</p>
<h6 data-number="3.3.1.1.0.1"
id="define-goals-using-the-smart-formula."><span
class="header-section-number">3.3.1.1.0.1</span> Define goals using the
SMART formula.</h6>
<p><img src="images/SmartGoals.jpeg" alt="SMART Goals Meaning" /> Autor:
Dmitry</p>
<p>Using the SMART method is a good way to define a goal. It applies
various criteria against which the goal definition is measured. This way
you have the guarantee to reach a smart goal.</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>pecific: Is it really clear what you want to do, or
are you perhaps too vague in your wording? What is included, and
especially what is not? Only if you really know exactly what you want to
do and at the same time know the limits of your intention, you can set
out and be sure that you will arrive on the way in any case without
getting bogged down or even losing your orientation.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong>essbar: What must have happened so that you can say
that your goal has been achieved. What work result is there then? For
example, if you want to get “better” at something, what do you need to
do and how often to get enough practice? Formulate in such a conclusive
and measurable way that you can achieve just that. Essentially, ask
yourself what you want to get better at or what exactly this “better”
can be tied to. Characterize the first point, because the more specific
you are in defining your goal, the more likely you are to get a result
that meets your expectations, that can be further improved, and that can
be markedly evaluated.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>ttractive: Your goal must motivate you. You must
want to achieve it if you want to spend 12 weeks to make it come true.
Therefore, this point is especially important. It should be a goal that
you have personally chosen for yourself and with which you can identify
100%. A goal that others set for me will rarely trigger the same desire
in me to achieve it as one that springs from my own heart. In some
explanations of the SMART formula, the A also stands for
<strong>A</strong>nchallenging. Will mean that your goal should not be
too easy. You should make a little effort and challenge yourself,
because if you stay too far away from your personal limits and actually
still chill in your comfort zone, you can rarely really improve.
Ultimately, you need to go a little beyond your comfort zone without
completely overtaxing yourself, because that’s where growth begins.
Caution. Overextending yourself won’t yield sustainable results, and by
and large, this learning path is meant to bring one thing above all
else: a lot of fun! And that can quickly fall by the wayside if your
goals are too ambitious.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/3-zonen-lernmodell.png" alt="3 Zonen Lernmodell" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">3 Zonen Lernmodell</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>R</strong>ealistic: The learning path goes 12 weeks and
therefore you should also choose a goal that is really achievable in
this time. Stay down to earth when defining your goals. You can achieve
anything at a snail’s pace and with perseverance. It is also key to
question yourself in advance: Are you one of those people who like to
choose their goals a little more challenging? How much time do you
really have available each week? Does the whole thing really fit into
the framework of the 12 weeks of the Learning Sprint? If it has to be,
then say goodbye to one or the other idea for the time being.
Ultimately, the first sprint is good training that will eventually
become second nature. The current learning sprint may only have been a
prelude. :-)</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>erminated: Another important requirement of your
goal that you should pay attention to is the date of completion. In the
context of the learning sprint, this date can actually be determined
very precisely. And that’s important, too, because it gives you the
opportunity to check whether you’re still on track in terms of
deliverables, open items, and any problems or obstacles, or whether you
might need to put more energy into your work on the project or
conclusively scale down your goal in order to achieve it at all. In week
7 we will look at the first interim results. A good moment to look at
your own goal again from the SMART perspective and if necessary to
readjust it a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Example of goal setting with OKRs</strong>.</p>
<p>As easy as the card box is to explain, as challenging it can be to
work with it at the beginning. For this reason, we recommend setting a
concrete goal and possibly starting with a small project. To make this a
little more concrete, here is an example.</p>
<p>Nima has started to study wants to work in science in the future, so
clean scientific work and the corresponding writing organization should
be practiced from the beginning.</p>
<p>Nima’s goal for week 12 in the notebox learning path is to develop a
routine in using the notebox. Therefore, Nima is considering working on
this very routine with an upcoming term paper. For starters, it is very
challenging to write 15 pages from the note box, so it makes sense to
define even more key outcomes.</p>
<p>The question that can help you to define the Key Results is: How do I
know that I am getting closer to my Objective?</p>
<p>1st Key Result: The key result that is obvious is the 15 pages
written. 2nd Key Result: Nima has developed a complete workflow. This
includes a reading routine, transferring notes to permanent notes,
linking thoughts,….</p>

<p>Do you take enough time for your personal development and to work on
your goals? Many people are busy with their daily tasks and don’t care
enough about their development and well-being. A good approach is to
make an appointment with yourself and reserve this time in your
calendar.</p>

<p>When it comes to organizing your personal knowledge management,
choosing the right program can be helpful. A good program will give you
the ability to store your notes in one place and ensure that you have
access to the information you need at any time.</p>
<p>There are many different programs on the market that focus on
different ways of working and personal preferences. It may be wise to
take the time to look into different programs to find the one that best
fits your needs.</p>
<p>It is important that your knowledge is stored in a format that
considers future viability. However, it is important to remember that
programs can change over time and it may be necessary to choose a
different program.</p>
<p>It is important to note that your choice of program is not set in
stone and you have the ability to change your decision at any time. To
help you with your decision, we have created a questionnaire to give you
a start. However, it is important to note that this is only a guide and
it is not the only option.</p>
<p>There are also programs like OneNote and Evernote that may not be for
everyone, depending on what features and requirements you have. It’s
important to review the different options and choose the program that
best fits your needs.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.3.2.1" id="questionnaire-to-choose-a-program"><span
class="header-section-number">3.3.2.1</span> Questionnaire to choose a
program</h4>
<p>You can use the questionnaire to support your choice for a tool:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>what kind of data do you want to store and organize (e.g. texts,
images, audio files)?
<ol type="1">
<li>i want to store and organize mainly text files. (A)</li>
<li>i want to store and organize mainly text files and images. (B)</li>
<li>i want to store and organize mainly text files, images and audio
files. (C)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Which features do you need (e.g. branch structure, version history,
markdown support)?
<ol type="1">

(B)</li>
<li>i need a branch structure, version history, markdown support and the
ability to view multiple branches at once. (C)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How important is the ability to access your data from anywhere?
<ol type="1">
<li>It is very important to me to be able to access my data from
anywhere. (A)</li>
<li>it is important to me to be able to access my data from anywhere,
but it is not the most important feature for me. (B)</li>
<li>It is not that important to me to be able to access my data from
anywhere. (C)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How important is the ability to collaborate with others to you?
<ol type="1">
<li>it is very important to me to be able to collaborate with other
people. (B)</li>
<li>it is important to me to be able to collaborate with other people,
but it is not the most important feature for me. (A, C)</li>
<li>it is not so important for me to be able to cooperate with other
people. (A, B, C)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How important is the ability to export and backup your data to you?
<ol type="1">
<li>it is very important to me to be able to export and backup my data.
(A, B, C)</li>
<li>it is important to me to be able to export and backup my data, but
it is not the most important feature for me. (A, B, C)</li>
<li>it is not so important for me to be able to export and save my data.
(A, B, C)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How important is the customizability and extensibility of the
software to you?
<ol type="1">
<li>it is very important to me that the software is customizable and
extensible. (B,C)</li>
<li>it is important to me that the software is customizable and
extensible, but it is not the most important feature for me. (A)</li>
<li>it is not so important to me that the software is customizable and
extensible. (A, B)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>What platforms does the software support (e.g., Windows, Mac, Linux,
iOS, Android)?
<ol type="1">
<li>I need the software on Windows and Mac. (A, B, C)</li>
<li>i need the software on Windows, Mac and Linux. (A, B, C)</li>
<li>i need the software on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. (A, B,
C)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>what pricing and subscription models does the software offer?
<ol type="1">
<li>I am willing to pay for the software and agree to a subscription
model. (A, B, C)</li>
<li>I am willing to pay for the software, but I prefer a one-time
purchase model. (A, B, C)</li>
<li>I am not willing to pay for the software and am looking for a free
alternative. (A, B, C)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>what kind of visualizations and diagrams do you need?
<ol type="1">
<li>I need the ability to visualize my data in mind-map form and
graph-based charts. (A)</li>
<li>i need the ability to present my data in mind-map form, graph-based
diagrams, and other types of diagrams and visualizations. (B)</li>
<li>I do not need special features for visualization and diagrams.
(C)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Count the letters together. Depending on which letter you have the
most choices, A: Roam, B: Obsidian, C: Logseq could be the most suitable
for you.</p>
<p>This questionnaire is only a help and there is no guarantee that one
of the above tools is the best for you. It is recommended to test the
tools yourself to make sure it meets your requirements. (And they are
not the only tools, they are only common tools)</p>
<p>If it is not possible for you to use a program optimized for
knowledge management, e.g. due to restrictions of company IT policies,
you can also start with OneNote. In the appendix (Guide to implement PKM
with OneNote) you will find some notes. Also how to switch from a
proprietary format to Mark-Down.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.4.1.1" id="types-of-notes"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.1</span> Types of notes</h4>
<p>It is not mandatory to use the terms, and the types can overlap and
blend into each other. Just think of it as helpful background knowledge
to guide you, and keep an open mind and flexibility in the application
itself. The notebox is a living system and so it adapts to you.</p>
<h5 data-number="3.4.1.1.1" id="cursory-notes"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.1.1</span> cursory notes</h5>
<p>When you read a text and underline, mark up, write a few notes in the
margin, or even write down notes while listening to it, these are
ephemeral notes. Fleeting because usually after a few hours, after a few
days you can no longer quite grasp the meaning of your underlining, key
points or have completely forgotten. Maybe you have experienced this in
school when you wanted to prepare for a class assignment and went
through your notes ;-)</p>
<h5 data-number="3.4.1.1.2" id="literature-notes"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.1.2</span> Literature Notes</h5>
<p>The literature note, or bibliographic note, is the reference to the
source of the information. The purpose of the bibliographic note is to
record the source of the information. Depending on what you expect of
yourself, you may want to include more or less information. If you are
working scientifically, you will need to include more information, as
there are usually general guidelines for this, which we will not go into
here. Apart from that, you should always note down the following
information - author - Book title/Internet link - date of
publication</p>
<h5 data-number="3.4.1.1.3" id="permanent-notes"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.1.3</span> Permanent notes</h5>
<p>Your thoughts about the information are in the Permanent Notes. Every
note you put in your notebox is meant to stay in your notebox forever.
Hence permanent. It is irrelevant if you keep rewriting the note with
the newest information or if you create new notes with new information
and link them.</p>
<h5 data-number="3.4.1.1.4" id="map-of-contents-index"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.1.4</span> Map of Contents /
Index</h5>
<p>Map of Content or Index notes are entry points on a higher level.
Later we will come to how such notes are created. Here it is only about
the fact that you already know that such a thing exists. When you have a
lot of notes in your system, you will need a method to find your
thoughts when you need them. And that’s where these Map Of Contents
help. By the way, there can be several levels of them, depending on how
extensive your thoughts on a topic are.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.4.1.2" id="structure---dna-of-a-note"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.2</span> Structure - DNA of a
note</h4>
<p>A structure for notes? Since it is not enough to simply record the
thought, but it needs to be coherently “taken in hand” in order to
creatively stand in (d)context, there is a structure for this. The
thought itself is certainly the most important thing in the whole,
ultimately it comes from a context and is thought in a new one. Directly
following this is the retrievability of the thought. On the one hand you
have to grasp it quickly and on the other hand this only happens if you
follow the always same structure of the note. This way your brain has
accordingly the capacities it needs free to actually grasp the
information dynamically. The recognition effect that is in the DNA of
your note can actually serve you well….</p>
<p>You can use your own structure. Maybe you already have one you feel
comfortable with and want to keep using it. That’s perfectly fine. You
can also create one according to your own ideas. The important thing is
that you stay consistent with it. Changes over time are natural with
increasing knowledge. But you should not reinvent your structure every
week or even every note ;-)</p>
<p>Here is a suggestion for a structure</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/node-dna.png" alt="DNA of a note" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">DNA of a note</figcaption>
</figure>
<h5 data-number="3.4.1.2.1" id="metadata"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.2.1</span> Metadata</h5>
<p>Here you can enter information like author, source, date, tags and
alias. With most PKM programs this information can also be searched and
displayed selectively. Thus, the information of the literature note can
also be embedded in the metadata.</p>
<h5 data-number="3.4.1.2.2" id="title"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.2.2</span> Title</h5>
<p>Each note needs also a title with which it can be identified
unambiguously.</p>
<h5 data-number="3.4.1.2.3" id="thought"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.2.3</span> Thought</h5>
<p>Here is the actual note. The thought you have. Knowledge, thoughts,
conclusions, what you have in your head.</p>
<h5 data-number="3.4.1.2.4" id="questions"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.2.4</span> Questions</h5>
<p>If you ask yourself questions about the thought, you can put them in
an extra questions section. This way you can always find your unanswered
questions immediately.</p>
<h5 data-number="3.4.1.2.5" id="footer"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.2.5</span> Footer</h5>
<p>In the footer could be links to other relevant notes that are not in
the text, but still have a relevance to the topic. The source, the
literature noitz, could also be placed here.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.4.1.3" id="note-in-your-own-words"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.3</span> Note in your own words</h4>
<p>If you can reproduce a thought in your own words, then you have
understood the thought. In essence, you can check whether you have
acquired the knowledge or not. If you express the thought in your own
words and can’t find the right words for it, you realize that you didn’t
understand it after all or maybe you need to practice to improve your
performance. If you can express it in your own words, you will already
use your own linguistic (or visual) meta-model. All this will most
likely guarantee that in a few years you will still be able to express
the idea and that it will be understood. This topic will be discussed
again in detail in the kata <em>Creating durable notes</em>.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.4.1.4" id="progressive-summarization"><span
class="header-section-number">3.4.1.4</span> Progressive
Summarization</h4>
<p>Progressive Summarization is a technique to summarize a text in
iterative steps and reduce it to the essentials. Ideally, 10% text
remains after each iteration.</p>
<p>Step 1: the complete text excerpt from a source Step 2: underline or
mark in bold the most important statements/sentences of the text Stage
3: From the underlined/bold marked the most important keywords
highligted that are important for the statement. Level 4: A summary in
your own words Stage 5: Bounding</p>
<p>In this process, the original text remains available at all times. If
a higher level is not understood, the level below can be read. The
method acts much like a safety net. Also, the method can still be used
well when not so much energy is available. The method is a method, it
does not have to be used. You can also record what you have read, heard
or seen directly as audio, thereby increasing your social presence
within a learning group, or reproduce it in your own words in a timely
manner.</p>

<p>Successful personal knowledge management in the notebook requires
regular work. By taking time to regularly create and process notes, you
can continuously increase your knowledge. Often it is enough to create a
few, but regular notes. Every note, every linking of notes, and the
thoughts that arise from them contribute to the increase of your
knowledge. It is important to understand that knowledge management is a
marathon and not a sprint, so you should also take time to take small
steps.</p>
<p>To make note-taking easier and more energy-efficient, it’s helpful to
establish routines. You can do this, for example, by setting specific
days or times when you create and process notes.</p>
<p>Fleeting notes, such as those created during a meeting or lecture,
should be processed as quickly as possible to help you remember them
later. The shorter the interval between the creation of the note and its
processing, the better you can remember it later.</p>
<p>To create your first note in the note box, you can use the
information from Week 3 (Getting to Know Notes). The topic of your first
note is not that important, it should just be something that interests
you but is not so important that it paralyzes you. It’s perfectly fine
to create multiple notes and link them - try it out and see how it works
for you.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.5.1.1" id="tip"><span

<p>If you’re unsure about what information to include in your
Zettelkasten, you can check the information against the following
criteria: - the information speaks to me - the information makes me
think - I need the information for a topic I am working on. If
necessary, look again at <em>week 3 - Getting to Know Notes</em>.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.5.1.2" id="tip-2"><span

notes</h2>
<h3 data-number="3.6.1" id="theory-6"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6.1</span> Theory</h3>
<p>Creating notes requires some thought in order to effectively manage
personal knowledge. An important foundation here is the atomicity of
notes.</p>
<p>Atomicity means that each note refers to exactly one idea. This idea
should be elementary and to the point, without prose or unnecessary
details. Because of the atomic structure of notes, large ideas or
abstract considerations can be created from many small building blocks,
or thought processes can be connected.</p>
<p>An important component of a note is the title. This should be unique
and designed to be as eloquent as possible. In this way, it is already
possible to recognize from the title what the note is about and whether
it can be useful for the current project. It is recommended to limit the
length of the title to ~20 words<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the length of the note, the text should be kept short to be
able to capture the thought quickly. As a guideline, you can use 450
words or a DINA 6 page.</p>
<p>In summary, creating notebook-style notes effectively requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomicity: each note should relate to one elementary idea, without
prose or unnecessary details.</li>
<li>Unique, speaking title: the title should get to the heart of the
note’s idea and be limited to 20 words if possible.</li>
<li>Short text length: the text should be kept short in order to capture
the idea quickly, guideline is 450 words or one DINA 6 page.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="3.6.2" id="exercises-6"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6.2</span> Exercises</h3>
<ul>
<li>Find a piece of paper that does not fit into the criteria. The
criteria are
<ul>
<li>Only one idea on the note?</li>
<li>Does the note fit on a DINA6 page (~450 words)?</li>
<li>the title reflects the basic idea</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rewrite the note so that the criteria are met.
<ul>
<li>divide it into several notes if necessary, one idea per note</li>
<li>Delete unnecessary text (prose)</li>
<li>Make the title short, concise and meaningful so that it directly
reflects the idea.
<ul>
<li>Ideally, it can be used as a sentence directly in a text.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>What is the benefit of talking titles? - How can you make sure that a
note actually refers to a single idea? - How can you make the title of a
note as meaningful as possible and give a quick overview of the note’s
content? - How can one ensure that the length of a note is appropriate
and allows the idea to be captured quickly? - To what extent does it
help knowledge management to organize notes into atomic units? - How do
you proceed when you come across a note that does not adhere to the
criteria? What steps are necessary to adjust it? - To what extent is it
beneficial to build the titles of notes as a sentence and how can you
implement this?</p>

<p>We start at one thought and move sequentially from there to the next
thought. In the end, we have come from one starting point to a
completely different point by chaining.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/thought-chain.png"
alt="Model of the thought chain with notes" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Model of the thought chain with
notes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The same thing happens now with linking notes. A thought starts in a
note, which leads to another thought (note), and on and on. This is a
fundamental aspect of dovetailing, connecting information that has to do
with each other.</p>
<p>From this connecting of information, clusters of topics emerge. This
is what is meant by bottom-up in this context. Areas/topics are not
defined in advance, but the topics are formed by the accumulation of
knowledge and networking with each other to form topic areas.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/bottom-up-example.png"
alt="Emergence of bottom-up topic clusters" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Emergence of bottom-up topic
clusters</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Thus, not only topic clusters but also natural entry points for
topics are created by the divergence. Connections <em>grow</em> between
topics that were not known before. This can lead to new ideas or even
completely new approaches: something new emerges. In this way, your
knowledge connects in your own notebook just as it is laid out in the
neuronal structure of your brain, and in the process it sinks in deeper
and deeper.</p>
<p>A piece of information is best found when there are many links on it.
This is predetermined by the brain’s system. You use this when you
create your note. Therefore, linking relevant information increases the
findability and memorability of the information. Note-taking is also
important for this. It keeps the information in the Zettelkasten
together and makes it accessible so that you can think and work with it
on a deeper level (your long-term memory).</p>
<p>The more notes you have in your box, the more important and clear it
becomes. Even if you only have a few notes in your Zettelkasten, it’s
worth starting now so that it grows. This way you will save knowledge
and deepen it at the same time.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.6.6" id="exercises-7"><span
class="header-section-number">3.6.6</span> Exercises</h3>
<p>In the last kata, you already made notes more atomic, so now you can
capture the idea of the note more quickly.</p>
<p>Go through the notes in your Zettelkasten and if you notice that two
ideas belong together, can look out for each other, or are otherwise
connected, link them together.</p>
<p>If questions come to mind as you read the note, look for answers in
your Zettelkasten and link them if you find notes that match.</p>
<p>Break down other notes into smaller components (keyword atomicity,
from week 6), linking them as you go, as soon as you get the impression
that they should be related.</p>
<p>You can also create direct links to other notes that you know are
related when adding permanent notes.</p>
<p>You can put the link in the Footer<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> area, or you can link
inline<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
<p>And keep in mind, a link is not only to the same topics, but can also
be a completely new link, just the one you see. You could also create a
new note explaining for yourself why you see a connection between the
two notes. The following image illustrates this. <img
src="images/erklaerende-Notiz-zwischen-zwei-Notizen.png"
alt="erklärende Notiz zwischen zwei Notizen" /></p>
<p>Note: If you are working a lot and intensively on a topic, it might
make sense to set up an additional time per week where you only focus on
linking ideas to each other. Tags like they exist in Obisidian can be
helpful to link not yet linked notes.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have made it this far and have come a long way!
You now have the most important foundations for your personal knowledge
management, namely:</p>
<p>An important foundation is your PKM-environment. Here you will find
all your information and notes. You have already learned about different
types of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>cursory notes,</li>
<li>literature notes,</li>
<li>permanent notes and</li>
<li>the “map of contents</li>
</ul>
<p>Another important basis is the structure of a note. With a consistent
structure, you can quickly orient yourself and better grasp and add
information. A unique title, preferably a speaking title, and the
thought succinctly to the point supports you in your knowledge work.
Metadata helps you to find information.</p>
<p>Another important concept is branching out. Link your thoughts and
create natural entry points into topics. This creates connections
between different topics and can lead to new ideas and approaches. By
linking relevant information you increase findability and
memorability.</p>
<p>Do you still have open questions? Are you still on track and have
your learning goal clearly in mind or has your goal changed and should
therefore be readjusted?</p>
<p>Outlook: - Finding information, - Create a “map of content” and think
in a box of notes, - Establish a workflow so that you can expand and use
your knowledge in the best possible way in the future.</p>

retrieval</h2>
<h3 data-number="3.8.1" id="theory-9"><span
class="header-section-number">3.8.1</span> Theory</h3>
<p>You have now already created some notes in your note box. But your
notes are still easy to keep track of. However, if your note box
continues to grow, it may start to become confusing. Therefore, it is
now a question of how you can find your knowledge in your note box
again, if it becomes more and more extensive. An important requirement
of your system is the retrievability of information.</p>
<p>Retrievability means being able to find information you once stored
later when you need it. This contrasts with information retrieval, where
you know the information you are looking for is in a specific document
and you have to search that document specifically. An important aspect
of linking knowledge is the ability to link to notes that fit the topic.
Of course, this is most easily done if you remember that you have that
information in your Zettelkasten. Otherwise, we are already in the
topic, how do you find information back in your note box?</p>
<p>Successful knowledge management should therefore originate bottom-up
topic oriented and have indexes, or map of content notes, as entry
points. This way, you can avoid getting lost in the flood of notes and
instead search specifically for information that you had in your head
but can no longer name precisely. Or even “stumbles” across information
that you had “forgotten” was in the system.</p>
<p>Factors that influence the retrievability of information include the
structure and organization of the notes, the use of keywords and tags,
the possibility of full-text search, and the use of metadata.</p>
<p>One way to improve retrievability is to create indexes or a Map of
Content (MOC). This defines major points of contact from which more
detailed information can be accessed. Another option is the use of tags
to quickly browse topic affiliations. However, the TAGs should be used
rather sparingly, too many TAGs can lead to not seeing the forest for
the trees. TAGs should also be maintained regularly to remain useful. A
full-text search within the notes makes it possible to search
specifically for certain terms. By using metadata, such as aliases,
authors or book titles, notes can be filtered and sorted specifically.
Another way to make notes retrievable is to link them to each other.
This makes it easy to move from one topic to the next and keep the
information thematically coherent. What emerges in the previous exercise
when you get bogged down. Train of thought.</p>

stages</p>
<h3 data-number="3.8.5" id="theory-10"><span
class="header-section-number">3.8.5</span> Theory</h3>
<p>You may be wondering, what is a MOC and why do you need MOCs in your
Zettelkasten? MOCs are entry points to larger subject areas. They are a
map to your knowledge with which you can safely orient yourself within a
topic area. They allow you to get a quick overview without having to
read all the details again. If necessary, you can of course read deeper
into the details. As I said, you can get an overview of a topic with a
lot of notes by using a MOC and you can also elaborate it more. Think of
a MOC as a room where all the notes on a topic can exist without you
having to combine them directly in a meaningful way, but you could. You
can just create a room in your Zettelkasten that contains all the notes
on a topic and you don’t have a compulsion to link them directly now in
a logical and sequential way. They may all be in there.</p>
<p>Now you may ask yourself, when should you create a MOC? You should
create a MOC when you have the feeling to lose the overview of a topic.
Then it is really high time. An indication could also be if you keep
looking for information, but can’t find it directly.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>get all notes about the topic into a new note</li>
<li>weigh the notes against each other, work out thoughts, divide,
structure. This is where new insights emerge because you are intensely
engaged with your thoughts. This process can take several days. You
create an overview of the topic based on your notes.</li>
<li>Link the MOC in the system and ensure findability</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that MOCs will continue to evolve, they are not static.
As your knowledge grows the time will come to update a MOC. The notes
will be weighed against each other again. A MOC can in turn contain
several MOCs and thus a whole hierarchy of MOCs on a topic can
emerge.</p>
<p>Here again the most important points to MOCs - offers entry points to
larger topics and helps to get an overview and to work out topics with
many notes. - Should be created when there is a feeling of losing track
of a topic. - MOCs can evolve - a MOC can contain several MOCs.</p>
<h3 data-number="3.8.6" id="exercises-9"><span

box</h2>
<h3 data-number="3.9.1" id="theory-11"><span
class="header-section-number">3.9.1</span> Theory</h3>
<p>The note box is not only a collection of read knowledge, it also
stores the own thoughts about the read knowledge, about work results and
generally own thoughts and ideas. With this fund of material, the slip
box can serve as a conversation partner. It is asked questions and the
note box provides answers, if it has any. New connections, insights and
new questions arise from this. It is thought in the note box, or with
the note box. The interesting aspect becomes that thinking becomes more
objective, since all previous thoughts can lie on the table, can lie
next to each other. It becomes possible to objectively draw comparisons
between parallel and even contradictory thoughts. When a question
arises, it is a good approach to search in the first instance in one’s
own note box, because there is already a high quality of thoughts and
selections. When thinking in the note box, I try to answer my own
questions that I have about a thought, further questions. One thing
leads to another and a train of thought unfolds. Either until all
answers are found or the interest in this train of thought is lost. This
thinking in the note box is part of the magic of the note box, it
expands and sharpens one’s knowledge and in the process allows new
insights to emerge.</p>
<p>By the way, if you find notes in your slip box that contradict each
other, neither is removed. Instead, another note is created that deals
with the contradiction, e.g. why it is a contradiction. Whether there
are areas where sometimes one is <em>correct</em>, sometimes the other.
A contradiction offers the possibility to learn and grow from it.
Likewise it leads to the clearer demarcation of the statements. So it is
anything but a problem.</p>
<h4 data-number="3.9.1.1" id="tip-on-structure"><span
class="header-section-number">3.9.1.1</span> Tip on structure</h4>
<p>The way of noting is open. It is recommended to use a mechanism how
still open questions can be found. e.g. with a TAG #question. Likewise a
fixed arrangement is helpful where in the notes open questions are to be
able to recognize this fast. Here from the Kata [[Zettelkasten Lernpfad
- Kata - Notizen kennenlernen#Struktur - DNA einer Notiz]] is fallen

<p>If you can’t think of questions right away, you can also use
Socrates’ questions for yourself:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>clarifying your own thinking and explaining the origins of your
ideas (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?).</li>
<li>questioning assumptions (How do I know this is true? What if I think
the opposite?)</li>
<li>looking for evidence (How can I prove this? What are the
sources?)</li>
<li>considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How
do I know I’m right?)</li>
<li>examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong? What
are the consequences if I am wrong?)</li>
<li>questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? Was I

<p>A workflow is of great benefit in staying on task and working more
effectively. An established workflow helps to find a habit, use time
more effectively, avoid distractions and focus on the task at hand.
Habits require less energy and allow you to constantly optimize your
work process. A Zettelkasten workflow should include steps such as
collecting notes, processing notes, writing permanent notes, creating
Map Of Contents, and thinking in the Zettelkasten. When thinking in the
Zettelkasten, you should ask questions, find answers, generate new
ideas, work systematically with the Zettelkasten, and connect knowledge
systematically. To establish a workflow, you should first define a goal,
list the tools you use, and put the steps in order. The steps and tools
should be connected and the workflow should be reviewed and adjusted
regularly to keep it up to date. A workflow stays alive if it is
executed, reviewed and adjusted on a regular basis. Regularity in
execution and review is important to ensure it is still current and
meets your needs. Adjustments should therefore be made regularly to keep
it up to date.</p>

<p>This week there is no clearly defined program with further exercises
- now is the time to let the Sprint come to an end together.</p>
<p>Talk about the Circle and your experiences from the last weeks. Share
what you learned and what the learning path did to you.</p>
<p>Wow, you did it and the Sprint is complete. Congratulations!</p>
<p>Where do you go from here?</p>
<p>Some Circles continue to meet regularly (e.g., every 2 bit 4 weeks).
Topics from the learning path can be deepened again.</p>
<p>You may also have developed your own ideas in your Circle that you
would like to work on in the future. Maybe you bring in ideas from your
own fields of work, or you bring in ideas from other areas of interest.
From these you create your own exercises. Discuss which activities you
want to fill the weeks after the sprint with, because it is important to
stick with it and to further consolidate the skills and the positive
habits you have built up during the sprint.</p>
<p>Define bindingly how you want to proceed more wisely (appointments,
tools, personal meetings, etc.).</p>

<h1 data-number="4" id="appendix"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Appendix</h1>
<p><img src="images/Markdown.png" alt="Markdown" /> ## What is
Mark-Down?</p>
<p>Markdown is a markup language. This means that control characters are
used in the text to indicate how the text should be displayed. So the
control characters really go directly into the text. It could be
compared to HTML<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> or LaTeX<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.
But don’t worry, you don’t have to program here, very few characters are
enough and the programs then display the text without the control
characters. To give you an idea of what this is all about, here is a
practical example.</p>
<p>On the left is the text with the formatting characters. On the left
is what you then see in the display. <img
src="images/Vergleich-MarkDown-Gerendert.png"
alt="Comparison to mark-down syntax and rendered view" /></p>
<p>The big advantage is that they are all text files (like the .txt
extension you sometimes see on your computer). So they are readable on
any system. The extension .md says only that syntax for interpretation
is included in the format mark-down.</p>
<h3 data-number="4.0.1" id="control-characters"><span
class="header-section-number">4.0.1</span> Control characters</h3>
<p>Already with two control characters the text can be brought into a
structure and notes can be connected with each other.</p>
<ul>
<li>#, ##, ###, …., For overwritings
<ul>
<li># first hierarchical level</li>
<li># second hierarchical level</li>
<li>## third hierarchical level etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[<em>note-name</em>]] to create links to other notes –&gt;
branching</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s basically all you need to get started.</p>
<p>Here are a few more control characters that are very handy, but not
necessary. Just use the ones you feel comfortable with and which you
think you need as formatting.</p>
<ul>
<li>**<strong>Bold formatted</strong>**</li>
<li>*<em>Cursive formatted</em>*</li>
<li>===Marker Marked===</li>
<li>\# –&gt; Creates a TAG, something like a sticker</li>
<li>[Text](http Link) –&gt; Creates a link to any address. E.g.
[Google](http://www.google.de)</li>
<li>[<em>Note</em>]] –&gt; Displays the contents of a note.</li>
<li>-- –&gt; creates a separator line</li>
</ul>
<p>Some programs also offer you buttons for this like in WYSIWYG
programs<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> (e.g. Word is such a program).</p>
<h3 data-number="4.0.2" id="advanced-mark-down-syntax"><span
class="header-section-number">4.0.2</span> Advanced mark-down
syntax</h3>
<ul>
<li>Metadata -–</li>
<li>Tables ||</li>
<li>Comments %</li>
<li>Citations &gt;</li>
<li>References ^</li>
<li>Block references with ^ and #
<ul>
<li>^ for blocks –&gt; [[example#^reference]]</li>
<li># for headings –&gt; [example#heading]]</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img
src="images/The_risks_and_limitations_of_proprietary_formats.png"
alt="The risks and limitations of proprietary formats" /> ## Change from
proprietary format to Mark-Down</p>
<p>This is for you if you have not used mark-down before. There are many
programs that use proprietary formats. Proprietary formats are formats
created by a particular company or developer that can only be used with
their products. An example of this would be the format of a note in the
Evernote app that cannot be opened in other note apps.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, there are difficulties and risks associated
with using proprietary formats. One of them is that you are trapped in a
dependency on a particular company or developer, since you cannot change
or export the format without using the corresponding product. Another
risk is that the format may eventually be discontinued by the company or
developer, which may mean that you can no longer open your notes. The
accumulated knowledge is then lost.</p>
<p>One solution to this could be to implement a switching strategy. One
possibility would be to create all new notes from now on in an open
format like Markdown, in a suitable program. If one then later searches
for old notes, one can search for them in the old program and then
transfer them to the new program. The advantage here would be that the
transfer only happens when it is really necessary and the energy is
distributed for it.</p>
Another suggestion for a switch strategy could be to look for tools that
can convert the proprietary format to an open format like Markdown. This
way, you could export your old notes to a format that is supported by
many different applications and you no longer have to feel dependent on
a particular company or developer.
