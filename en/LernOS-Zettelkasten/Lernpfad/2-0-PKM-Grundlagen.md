# Personal Knowledge Management Basics

In today's world, it is more important than ever to constantly acquire new knowledge and information. However, knowledge alone is not enough to be successful. It is just as important, if not more important, to think knowledge further in order to combine it into something new.
For example, to accomplish tasks and projects more efficiently, to adapt quickly to new demands and challenges, to better understand and pursue goals and plans, or to use study time more efficiently.
However, this is easier said than done. Fortunately, there are personal knowledge management methods that can help. One of these methods is the note box method.

The notebox method is based on a bottom-up topic structure and aims to put thoughts and ideas in one central place and connect them to each other in order to gain new insights, internalize knowledge and create sound texts. It may take a while to see the first results, but if you use the slip box method continuously, you will benefit from the rich harvest.

In order to use the note box method successfully, it is important to use it on a daily basis. Read and jot down your thoughts on what you read. Precisely formulate your notes and link your knowledge together. Connect your ideas and create overlapping connections. Ask yourself questions and try to answer them. Through this continuous thinking in the notebook, you will deepen your knowledge and generate new ideas.

In practice, the slip box method can be used in everyday work, study, and personal life. It can help to write well-founded articles, to make extensive thoughts tangible and to deepen your own knowledge. It is also helpful when writing articles, forum posts, social media posts, because you collect thoughts, prepare them and can insert them directly in an outline and have your contributions with depth already 90% ready.
