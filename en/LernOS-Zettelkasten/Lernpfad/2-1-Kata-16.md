## Kata 16 - Retrospective

Used in [Week 11](2-1-Woche-11.md)

### Theory
This week there is no clearly defined program with further exercises - now is the time to let the Sprint come to an end together.

Talk about the Circle and your experiences from the last weeks. Share what you learned and what the learning path did to you.

Wow, you did it and the Sprint is complete. Congratulations!

Where do you go from here?

Some Circles continue to meet regularly (e.g., every 2 bit 4 weeks). Topics from the learning path can be deepened again.

You may also have developed your own ideas in your Circle that you would like to work on in the future. Maybe you bring in ideas from your own fields of work, or you bring in ideas from other areas of interest. From these you create your own exercises.
Discuss which activities you want to fill the weeks after the sprint with, because it is important to stick with it and to further consolidate the skills and the positive habits you have built up during the sprint.

Define bindingly how you want to proceed more wisely (appointments, tools, personal meetings, etc.).
