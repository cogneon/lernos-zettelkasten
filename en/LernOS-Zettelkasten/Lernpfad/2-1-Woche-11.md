## Week 11 - Reflection and conclusion

You've set out on your journey, but have you reached your destination? How do you go on? Have you found your passion? Is after the Circle before the Circle? And when are we actually going to celebrate?

### As preparation

- [ ] [Kata 16](2-1-Kata-16.md): Retrospective
- [ ] What's next? What do you plan to do next?

### In the Weekly

- [ ] Check in (2 minutes per member)

What has been on your mind this past week related to personal knowledge management?



This week there is no clearly defined program with further exercises. Now is the time to finish the Sprint together.

Talk about the Circle and your experiences in the last weeks. What you have learned and what the learning path has done with you.

How can you move forward after the Sprint?

Wow, you did it and the Sprint is complete. Congratulations! What can happen next? Some Circles continue to meet regularly, but at longer intervals (e.g., every 2 or 4 weeks instead of every week). This could be to work on certain topics from the learning path in more depth or to repeat katas and warm-ups. How about a new iteration of the learning path with new goals and a new focus?

You may also have your own ideas in your Circle about what you would like to work on further. Maybe you bring in application ideas from your own fields of work or interest and create exercises from them. Discuss what you want to do in the weeks after the Sprint, because it's important to keep at it so that the skills and positive habits you have built up in the Sprint are further consolidated.
