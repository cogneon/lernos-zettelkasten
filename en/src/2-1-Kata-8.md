## Week 7 - Pit stop


### Theory/Questions

Congratulations, you have made it this far and have come a long way! You now have the most important foundations for your personal knowledge management, namely:

One important foundation is the PKM environment itself that you have set up. It serves as a place for all your information and notes. There are different types of notes here, such as ephemeral notes, literature notes, permanent notes, and the "map of contents" (we'll get to those next week).

Another important foundation is the structure of a note. A consistent structure will help you quickly navigate your notes and better absorb the information. A unique title, preferably a speaking title, and getting to the heart of the thought succinctly supports you in your knowledge work. Metadata can be helpful to use to locate information through search and filters.

Another important concept is branching out. Link your thoughts and create natural entry points into topics. This creates connections between different topics and can lead to new ideas and approaches. By linking relevant information, you increase findability and memorability.

Before you continue learning, check if there are any open essential questions. Also check if you are still on course for the learning goal you defined at the beginning. Also check for yourself if the goal is still relevant for you or if you should adjust it (this is also possible).

As a preview of what learning units are still ahead of you. You will work on retrieving information, creating a map of content, and thinking in a box. We will also look at establishing a workflow so that you can expand and use your knowledge in the best possible way in the future.

### Tasks/Exercises
- Do your current goals still fit for you and how can you make sure you achieve them in the remaining 5 weeks?
	- If they no longer fit, why not change them so that they fit for you again (This is also possible).
- Write down the three basic questions you have regarding the notebook.
- Share your progress of your goals with your circle
- Discuss your questions with your circle

### Reflection part
- Do you feel confident using your slip box?
- Do you feel comfortable with your goal and how you have achieved it so far?

### Learning objective
- Determine whether your goal is being achieved
- Determine which questions are open with regard to the slip box
