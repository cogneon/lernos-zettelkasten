## Week 7 - Pit stop


### Theory

Congratulations, you have made it this far and have come a long way! You now have the most important foundations for your personal knowledge management, namely:

An important foundation is your PKM-environment. Here you will find all your information and notes. You have already learned about different types of notes:

- cursory notes,
- literature notes,
- permanent notes and
- the "map of contents

Another important basis is the structure of a note. With a consistent structure, you can quickly orient yourself and better grasp and add information. A unique title, preferably a speaking title, and the thought succinctly to the point supports you in your knowledge work. Metadata helps you to find information.

Another important concept is branching out. Link your thoughts and create natural entry points into topics. This creates connections between different topics and can lead to new ideas and approaches. By linking relevant information you increase findability and memorability.

Do you still have open questions?
Are you still on track and have your learning goal clearly in mind or has your goal changed and should therefore be readjusted?

Outlook:
- Finding information,
- Create a "map of content" and think in a box of notes,
- Establish a workflow so that you can expand and use your knowledge in the best possible way in the future.


### Exercises
- Do your current goals still fit for you and how can you make sure you achieve them in the remaining 5 weeks?
	- If they no longer fit, change them so that they fit for you again (this is also possible).
- Write down the three basic questions you have regarding the notebook.
- Share your progress of your goals with your circle
- Discuss your questions with your circle

### Reflection part
- Do you feel confident using your slip box?
- Do you feel comfortable with your goal and how you have achieved it so far?

### Learning objective
- Check whether your own goal can be achieved
- Determine which questions are open with regard to the slip box
