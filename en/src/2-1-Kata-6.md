## Kata 6 - Progressive Summarization

Verwendet in [Woche 2](2-1-Woche-2.md)

### Theory

Progressive Summarization, the term was defined by Tiago Forte, is a technique of summarizing a text in iterative steps and reducing it to its essentials.
Ideally, 10% of the text remains after each iteration.

Step 1: the complete text excerpt from a source
Step 2: underline or mark in bold the most important statements/sentences of the text
Stage 3: From the underlined/bold marked the most important keywords highligted that are important for the statement.
Level 4: A summary in your own words
Stage 5: Bounding

In this process, the original text remains available at all times. If a higher level is not understood, the level below can be read. The method acts much like a safety net.
Also, the method can still be used well when not so much energy is available.
The method is a method, it does not have to be used. You can also record what you have read, heard or seen directly as audio, thereby increasing your social presence within a learning group, or reproduce it in your own words in a timely manner.


### Exercises
- Write down your questions about what you have written above
- Discuss your understanding on notes and clarify the questions everyone has


### Learning Objective
