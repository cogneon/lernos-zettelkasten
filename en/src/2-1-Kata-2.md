## Week 2 - PKM Environment Setup

### Theory

When it comes to organizing your personal knowledge management, choosing the right program can be helpful. A good program will give you the ability to store your notes in one place and ensure that you have access to the information you need at any time.

There are many different programs on the market that focus on different ways of working and personal preferences. It may be wise to take the time to look into different programs to find the one that best fits your needs.

It is important that your knowledge is stored in a format that considers future viability. However, it is important to remember that programs can change over time and it may be necessary to choose a different program.

It is important to note that your choice of program is not set in stone and you have the ability to change your decision at any time. To help you with your decision, we have created a questionnaire to give you a start. However, it is important to note that this is only a guide and it is not the only option.

There are also programs like OneNote and Evernote that may not be for everyone, depending on what features and requirements you have. It's important to review the different options and choose the program that best fits your needs.


#### Questionnaire to choose a program
You can use the questionnaire to support your choice for a tool:

1. what kind of data do you want to store and organize (e.g. texts, images, audio files)?

	2. i want to store and organize mainly text files and images. (B)

	2. i need branch structure, version history and markdown support. (B)
	3. i need a branch structure, version history, markdown support and the ability to view multiple branches at once. (C)
3. How important is the ability to access your data from anywhere?
	1. It is very important to me to be able to access my data from anywhere. (A)

	2. it is important to me to be able to export and backup my data, but it is not the most important feature for me. (A, B, C)
	3. it is not so important for me to be able to export and save my data. (A, B, C)
6. How important is the customizability and extensibility of the software to you?
	1. it is very important to me that the software is customizable and extensible. (B,C)
	2. it is important to me that the software is customizable and extensible, but it is not the most important feature for me. (A)
	3. it is not so important to me that the software is customizable and extensible. (A, B)
7. What platforms does the software support (e.g., Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android)?
	1. I need the software on Windows and Mac. (A, B, C)
	2. i need the software on Windows, Mac and Linux. (A, B, C)
	3. i need the software on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. (A, B, C)
8. what pricing and subscription models does the software offer?

	2. i need the ability to present my data in mind-map form, graph-based diagrams, and other types of diagrams and visualizations. (B)
	3. I do not need special features for visualization and diagrams. (C)

Count the letters together. Depending on which letter you have the most choices, A: Roam, B: Obsidian, C: Logseq could be the most suitable for you.

This questionnaire is only a help and there is no guarantee that one of the above tools is the best for you. It is recommended to test the tools yourself to make sure it meets your requirements.
(And they are not the only tools, they are only common tools)

If it is not possible for you to use a program optimized for knowledge management, e.g. due to restrictions of company IT policies, you can also start with OneNote. In the appendix (Guide to implement PKM with OneNote) you will find some notes. Also how to switch from a proprietary format to Mark-Down.

If Markdown is foreign to you, and you want to use it in your Zettelkasten, check out the attachment. There is a crash course there. (In principle three characters are enough to use it)


### Exercises
- Choose a program, either with the help of the questionnaire or otherwise
- Install your chosen program
- Familiarize yourself with the program
- Create a note
	- Title: Hello world
	- Text: My first note

### Reflection section
1. what aspects are most important to you when choosing a program for personal knowledge management?
2. what kinds of notes do you take most often and what features would you need in a program to organize them?
3. how do you deal with the possibility that programs will change and possibly disappear from the market?

### Learning Objective
- You have installed and set up your Zettelkasten environment
- You have become aware of what is important to you for your box work.
