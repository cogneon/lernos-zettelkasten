## Week 0 - Circle Setup

### Theory/Questions
If you don't know each other in the Circle yet, get to know each other in week 0. Plan when you will meet, what tools you will use to share, and who will be the moderator.

Define a Circle facilitator who will handle event and time management. One of the biggest obstacles to successful Circle is discipline and time management. The moderator is not the "boss*in" of the Circle, but a normal Circle member who takes care of a smooth event. Define the day and time of the weekly meeting. Define whether you will meet in person or virtually. Define the tools you will use for communication and documentation in the Circle. Decide which of the suggested exercises you will do in the Circle and as homework. If necessary, define rules or behavioral labels that are helpful to you.

### Guiding questions you can answer for yourselves
- Alternating Circle facilitation?
- Day and time of Weekly?
- Weekly meetings are: in person / virtual?
- Tools used for offline communication (Can everyone use them?)?
- Where do we share the results? Do we use social media channels?
- Dealing with appointments where not all can attend (e.g. if 3 participants* cannot, the appointment is cancelled)?
- Attitude, principles for the Circle (e.g. the Circle should be fun! If you can't complete a task because you have other priorities that week, that's totally ok. We don't create additional stress)?


A very important function of the Circle is to get feedback on your goals, understanding and workflow and to give feedback to the others. To help you understand each other better in the process, take a moment to talk about your idea of constructive feedback. This includes the question "Why are you doing knowledge management?" and the principle "Compare yourself to yourself.


### Tasks/Exercises
- answer the guiding questions together and find a consensus
- exchange ideas about constructive feedback

### Reflection part
- How can we best give each other feedback to improve our goals and understanding?
- What are our personal reasons for using knowledge management in the Circle?
- How do we adhere to the principle of "compare yourself to yourself" in terms of feedback and goals?


### Learning Objective
- You gain clarity in the Circle about the approach and the organization
- You get a safe space for giving and receiving feedback.
